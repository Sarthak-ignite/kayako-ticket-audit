  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI used a largely templated, generic closure/update message and added potentially irrelevant instructions (enable logging/reproduce/send logs) despite stating the issue is already fixed and pending release, without providing concrete next steps like version/build numbers or an immediate workaround for disk usage.",
    "evidence": [
      "\u201cWe are pleased to inform you that our Development Team has successfully addressed the issue... This fix is slated for release next weekend.\u201d",
      "\u201cShould the problem persist after the update, we request that you enable logging and debugging, reproduce the issue, and send us the new set of logs for further investigation.\u201d",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support did not acknowledge or act on the customer\u2019s initial urgency and explicit request to route to Engineering until much later, effectively ignoring the context that the issue was already evidenced by a screenshot and was blocking upgrades.",
    "evidence": [
      "\u201cAs seen on the screenshot, GFI App Manager agents are piling up in the Exinda var folder... and block Exinda from successful update to the newer version. Please move this ticket to Engineering for fixing.\u201d",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There was a multi-week gap between the customer\u2019s initial report/follow-up and the first substantive support response/escalation, exceeding the 2-day threshold by a wide margin.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \u201cHi team, ... Please move this ticket to Engineering for fixing.\u201d (2025-11-12T15:24:17+00:00)",

  "P1_SEV1_MISHANDLING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the issue could impact upgrades via disk space exhaustion, the ticket does not explicitly indicate an outage/SEV1/P1 condition (no 'production down/critical/outage/urgent' signals), so it doesn\u2019t meet the stated detection criteria.",
