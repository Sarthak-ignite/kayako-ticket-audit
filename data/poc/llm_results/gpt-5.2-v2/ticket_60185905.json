The response reads partly like a template/KB dump rather than a precise analysis of why LDAP becomes forbidden after ~1 hour.",
    "evidence": [
      "\u201cThe debug log reveals the root cause: a critical LDAP connectivity failure occurs about one hour after Kerio Connect is restarted, indicated by the log: {ldapdb} Connections to LDAP servers were forbidden.\u201d",
