    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS responses are largely templated, repetitive link-dumps with minimal case-specific diagnosis, and it repeatedly suggests generic folder/path checks even after the customer indicates configuration hasn\u2019t changed and the core symptom is persistent VSE failures. The customer explicitly states the replies are \u201csame replies from a machine,\u201d indicating perceived low quality/unhelpful AI support.",
    "evidence": [
      "ATLAS commented publicly: \"Below are some targeted troubleshooting steps and references to help resolve the issue:\"",
      "ATLAS commented publicly: \"Verify Pickup and Replay Folder Configuration\" (repeated across multiple ATLAS replies)",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer requests a live support rep and repeatedly expresses frustration while ATLAS continues to respond with the same troubleshooting loop; no human engagement is shown. The interaction is a long chain of AI-only replies, and the customer calls out they are getting repetitive machine responses.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"Can we get a support rep online.... I've been looking at this for 3 hours now\"",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS continues to propose the same pickup/replay folder and generic queue-folder checks even after the customer states configuration is unchanged for years and provides new, specific evidence (Failed VSE for all scanned inbound emails).

    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"As I stated, all emails are flowing into building... Once I disable email scanning, email is aujtomatically received by user.\"",
      "Customer: \"As i stated, nothing changed on configuration. Has been the same for years. Only thing I noticed today was the Failed (VSE) errors for all scanned inbound emails\"",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Although an explicit closure message is not shown, the customer clearly gives up and threatens replacement due to lack of human help and unresolved outage symptoms; the ticket shows only AI interactions with no handoff to a human, which is a closure/abandonment risk pattern.",

    "reasoning": "This is effectively a mail-flow outage: all inbound emails stop reaching user inboxes when MailEssentials is enabled, forcing the customer to disable/uninstall security scanning to restore business-critical email delivery. Despite the severity and time sensitivity (\u201c3 hours\u201d), ATLAS stays in standard KB troubleshooting instead of urgent escalation/human takeover.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"Email not sent to exchange server\" and \"All emails.\"",
