    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS provided generic, assumption-based troubleshooting (\u201cknown scenario\u201d) and repeated standard steps that did not address the specific alternating/scheduled failure pattern, and initially guided the customer to paths that didn\u2019t match what the customer reported on their system.",

      "\u201cIf you have already performed the standard recovery steps ... let's focus on advanced troubleshooting steps...\u201d followed by more manual-update steps/links rather than analysis of the every-other-hour pattern"

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": true,

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support repeatedly suggested actions the customer had already performed and did not fully incorporate key context (missing folder claim; alternating success/fail pattern; logs already sent), leading to repeated information cycles.",

      "Customer: \u201cFollowed steps, still same issues. The updates are failing every other hour or so\u201d (pattern stated early, yet responses mostly re-ran standard update-reset steps).",

      "Customer: \u201cI tried to upload log files but the zip was too large at 97GB\u201d then later \u201cLog files.\u201d (no clear acknowledgment/analysis of the provided logs in the subsequent visible replies).",
      "Customer: \u201cI don't have the folder C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentialsAntivirusBitDefender\u201d (support guidance didn\u2019t directly resolve this discrepancy; instead it moved on with generic folder-based steps)."

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support repeatedly introduced a near-term auto-closure condition (\u201cticket will stay open for one week\u201d) while the customer explicitly stated the issue was unresolved, creating a risk of closure without resolution; the ticket was also effectively parked (\u201chold for 9999 hours\u201d).",

      "Customer: \u201cIt shows my email IP address sending 3000 to 12000 emails a day. This started as soon as we upgraded our license to add antivirus.\u201d",
