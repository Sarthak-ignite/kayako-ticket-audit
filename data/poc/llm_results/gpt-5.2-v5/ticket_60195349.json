    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is some AI chat transcript content in private notes, but no customer-facing (public) evidence shows ATLAS/Hermes providing broken/incorrect guidance or the customer reporting that the AI was wrong/useless. The public responses contain troubleshooting links and follow-up questions, which is not sufficient to mark an AI quality failure.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer did not explicitly request a human and then receive multiple subsequent AI-only responses; a human agent responded publicly on 2025-09-18. While the customer followed up multiple times, this appears to be due to response delay rather than being trapped in an AI loop.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although the customer shared installation logs in a private comment, there is no public statement from the customer that they already provided specific items (logs/screenshot/steps) and were asked to provide the exact same items again. Support\u2019s requests for additional artifacts (event logs/screenshot) are not clearly redundant based on public content alone.",
    "evidence": [

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer repeatedly followed up over multiple days asking for findings and a timeline, indicating they experienced a long wait without a meaningful update. The sequence of \u201clooking forward to hearing from you\u201d messages culminating in a request for a projected deadline is a strong signal of response delay.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer (2025-09-15): \"Dear Hermes, I look forward to hearing from you and the team with your findings.\"",
      "Customer (2025-09-17): \"Dear Hermes, I look forward to hearing from you and the team with your findings.\"",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support included auto-closure language (\u201cstay open for one week unless\u2026\u201d) while the customer still had unresolved questions about compatibility/version and installation outcome. This is visible in public text and appears before clear resolution/confirmation from the customer.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer reports an installation problem but does not describe an outage/production-down scenario, nor use explicit P1/critical/severity language. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to assess this as a high-severity mishandling case.",
