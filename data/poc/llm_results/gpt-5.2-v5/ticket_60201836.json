    "reasoning": "The initial ATLAS reply was largely generic and directed the customer to a status page for \u201clatest updates,\u201d but the customer pointed out the incident was not listed there and asked for concrete resolution steps. This indicates the AI guidance was not useful/actionable in context and may have been misleading about where to track the issue.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support did not ask the customer to re-send information already provided (e.g., the Loom video), and the customer did not explicitly complain that provided evidence was ignored. The thread progresses to analysis of metrics/health status rather than repeating the same requests.",
