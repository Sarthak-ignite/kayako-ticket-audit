    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No customer-facing AI loop is visible, and the customer does not request a human agent or express frustration about interacting with AI. Human agents respond publicly with acknowledgements and updates.",

    "detected": false,

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Response times appear to be within minutes to a couple hours on the same day, with multiple public updates. There are no multi-day gaps or apologies for delay in the customer-facing conversation.",
