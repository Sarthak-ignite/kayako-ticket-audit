    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS mainly performed intake/routing and did not provide troubleshooting guidance that was later shown to be incorrect. The only clear issue reported was a non-working link, but that came from a human agent message and is not sufficient to mark an AI quality failure.",
    "evidence": [
      "ATLAS commented privately: \"Ticket generated by Kerio Control AI chat on behalf of Kris Cardona\"",
      "Jan Paraniak commented publicly: \"please follow the steps outlined in the following article: Requesting RMA for Hardware Box\""

  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer requested a human in the chat, and the flow proceeded to ticket creation rather than trapping the customer in repeated AI responses. Subsequent interactions in the ticket do not show repeated customer-facing AI replies after a request for a human.",
    "evidence": [
      "Chat transcript: \"Kris Cardona: \ud83d\udcac Chat with live agent\"",
      "Chat transcript: \"Our agents are currently busy assisting other customers at the time, so we'll proceed with ticket creation\""

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support requested additional information (a video) needed for the RMA process; there is no clear instance where support asked again for the same details the customer explicitly said were already provided. While the customer expressed confusion/frustration, it is not tied to a repeated request for already-supplied information.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer commented privately: \"RMA request: ... Kerio Control Box NG510 Series ... LNKR24070037\"",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There are explicit, customer-facing indications of delay: support apologized for the delay and the customer repeatedly asked for updates/ETA, indicating they experienced a prolonged wait.",
    "evidence": [
      "Ciprian Nastase commented publicly: \"Please accept my sincere apologies for the delay in getting back to you\"",
      "Customer commented privately: \"Hi Hermes, any updates ? It's becoming a bit ridiculous at this stage, the client needs an answer for this.\"",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support closed the ticket stating the DOA/RMA was being handled directly via another channel (Apligo/GFI team). The ticket text does not show the customer disputing closure or stating the issue remained unresolved at the time of closure.",
    "evidence": [
      "Jozef Kacala commented privately: \"Apligo is dealing with RMA directly as its DOA. so no action is needed here.\"",

  "P1_SEV1_MISHANDLING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although the customer labeled the situation urgent, the described scenario was one HA unit failing (not an explicit production outage), and support took steps consistent with the RMA process rather than providing irrelevant generic troubleshooting. There is no clear evidence of a declared P1/outage being handled as routine without escalation.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer intake (private): \"1 of the 2 units in HA failed and no power, no lights\"",
      "Ciprian Nastase commented publicly: \"I have now marked the ticket as urgent.\""
