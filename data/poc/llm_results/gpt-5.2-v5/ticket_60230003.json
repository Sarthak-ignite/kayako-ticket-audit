  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The ticket text only shows the AI\u2019s greeting/intake and the customer\u2019s initial problem statement. The AI\u2019s actual troubleshooting content is truncated, and there is no customer feedback indicating the AI was wrong or unhelpful.",
    "evidence": []
  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no indication the customer requested a human or was stuck in a repetitive AI loop. The visible interaction shows only initial AI prompts and the customer\u2019s first issue description.",
    "evidence": []
  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no message indicating the ticket was closed or would be auto-closed, and no closure warning language is present in the visible text.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the customer reports the Outlook spam handler add-on is effectively blocked, there is no explicit P1/SEV1/critical/outage language or clear multi-user production-down impact shown in the provided content.",
    "evidence": [
      "After updating to ME 22.2 the outlook spam handler keeps asking for credentials that are already entered and stored, so the add on is essentilly blocked"
