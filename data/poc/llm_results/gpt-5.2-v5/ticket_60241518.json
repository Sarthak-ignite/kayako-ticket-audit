  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer-facing AI message communicates an engineering fix and next steps without obvious template breakage, contradiction, or customer complaint about wrong/irrelevant guidance. No evidence that AI promised something specific that was later shown to be undelivered in the ticket text.",
    "evidence": [
      "Cu Chulainn AI Manager commented publicly: Dear Jozef,\n\nWe are pleased to inform you that our Development Team has successfully addressed the issue concerning the GFI AppManager agent files accumulating under /var on Exinda 7.6.x. This fix is slated for release next weekend.",
      "We kindly ask you to update to the latest version once it becomes available and check if the issue has been resolved."

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no pattern of the customer being stuck in repeated AI replies after requesting a human; the ticket was escalated and a human (Randall) posted a public update. Only one AI public message appears, not a multi-message loop.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There were significant delays between the customer\u2019s public requests (Nov 12) and the first staff public response (Nov 30). This creates at least two separate >=3-day gaps (each customer message waited ~18 days for a staff reply).",

      "[2025-11-12T15:24:17+00:00] Jozef Kacala commented publicly: Hi team,\n\nAs seen on the screenshot, GFI App Manager agents are piling up in the Exinda var folder.",

      "Jozef Kacala commented publicly: As a result, they will occupy too much space and block Exinda from successful update to the newer version.",
