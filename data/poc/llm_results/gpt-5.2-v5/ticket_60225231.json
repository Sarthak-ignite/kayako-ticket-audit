This indicates misleading guidance that was corrected later in the ticket.",
    "evidence": [
      "\u201cThe license file information is incorrect or incompatible with your new Proxmox virtual environment. Since you migrated from a hardware box to Proxmox, the license file is still bound to the old hardware box's serial number and won't work properly on the new virtual appliance.\u201d",
