  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support did not ask the customer to re-provide the same information or ignore previously shared details; they acknowledged the disruption and later addressed the recurrence concern with an explanation and prevention steps. The customer\u2019s recurrence concern received a direct response rather than being treated as a brand-new issue.",

      "Customer: \"We have been encountering this issue repeatedly. Please review the history of previously raised tickets for reference.\"",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "All customer-facing replies occur within hours (same day or next day) and there are no multi-day silences, no customer 'any update' after days, and no apology for delay.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While support included a closure-warning policy statement, there is no visible message indicating the ticket was actually closed/auto-closed while a customer request remained unanswered.

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The issue was production-impacting and urgent, and support treated it as such by escalating to infrastructure with highest priority and communicating resolution; there is no evidence of extended generic end-user troubleshooting (e.g., cache/browser/VPN) without escalation.",

      "Customer: \"We are unable to view or claim any new incoming chats in Khoros Care Production.\"",
