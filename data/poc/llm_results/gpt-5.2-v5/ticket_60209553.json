    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer asked for live contact, but the ticket shows multiple human/staff public responses (Denis, Harry, Aditi, Arafat). There isn\u2019t evidence the customer was kept in an AI-only loop after requesting a human agent.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support asked for additional artifacts/logs and confirmation steps, but the customer does not explicitly state they already provided the same requested items or already performed the same steps and is being asked again. Lack of acknowledgement/frustration is present, but not enough to confirm context is being ignored per the rubric.",

      "Here is the support file from the unit before the 9.5.0 downgrade.",
