  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Customer-facing AI replies (Hermes) are largely non-actionable boilerplate repeated across updates, with no concrete next steps until much later. Additionally, the customer explicitly disputes ATLAS\u2019s apparent implication that the issue is due to configuration/virtual environment rather than a product defect.",
    "evidence": [
      "Hermes (public, 2025-09-15): \"Your input will be carefully reviewed to better understand the situation and determine the most appropriate next steps.\"",
      "Hermes (public, 2025-09-16 quoted email): \"Your input will be carefully reviewed to better understand the situation and determine the most appropriate next steps.\"",
      "Customer (public, 2025-09-25): \"I disagree that the problem is related to the configuration or the fact that I ran the tests in a virtual environment.\"",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although the ticket originated from an AI chat, the subsequent customer-facing thread includes multiple human-agent responses (e.g., Zubair, Atilla, Carlos, Mike, Aditi). There is no clear instance where the customer asked for a human and then received 2+ subsequent AI-only public responses without a human reply.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support requested screenshots and the customer provided them; later the customer provided a video as well. There is no clear customer-facing pattern of support repeatedly asking for the same information after the customer stated it was already provided.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There are multiple long gaps where the customer explicitly asks for an update after waiting. Notably, the customer asked for an update on 2025-09-16 and the next customer-facing response appears on 2025-09-24; later the customer replied on 2025-10-06 and the next staff response was 2025-10-13.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer describes a significant HA defect, but the ticket does not include explicit P1/SEV1/critical outage language in customer-facing messages. Support also escalated to Engineering and later provided a beta build, which is not indicative of treating an explicit SEV1 as routine without escalation.",
