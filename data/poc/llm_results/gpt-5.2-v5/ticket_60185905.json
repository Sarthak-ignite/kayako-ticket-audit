    "reasoning": "The only customer-facing staff reply provides a concrete log symptom and proposes plausible AD/Kerberos/DNS troubleshooting steps. There is no customer feedback indicating the guidance was incorrect or unhelpful, and no obviously broken/garbled template output is visible.",

      "\u201cthe debug log reveals the root cause: a critical LDAP connectivity failure occurs about one hour after Kerio Connect is restarted, indicated by the log: {ldapdb} Connections to LDAP servers were forbidden.\u201d",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is only one customer-facing AI/staff response shown, and the customer does not request a human agent or complain about being stuck with AI. No repetitive AI loop is evidenced in the public thread.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is one long gap (well over 5 days) between the customer\u2019s public update and the next staff public response, but the policy requires either a strong signal (e.g., customer complains about waiting / apology for delay) or 2+ weak signals.
