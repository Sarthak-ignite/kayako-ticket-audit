    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Customer indicates they are blocked by the automated/AI channel and cannot reach a human or properly open a technical ticket due to the chat flow/button not working. Multiple customer-facing statements show frustration with being kept in an AI/automation loop.",
    "evidence": [
