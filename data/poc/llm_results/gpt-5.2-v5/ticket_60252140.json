    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no customer-facing evidence that the customer was stuck interacting with AI or unable to reach a human. The public conversation contains multiple human agent replies (e.g., Randall, Deepanshu, Keyur, Ibiso, Andriy).",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the customer notes they already sent many logs, support\u2019s subsequent requests are for a fresh/clean set of logs after deleting previous data and reproducing the issue, which is additional diagnostic data rather than repeating the same request without acknowledgment.",

      "Kayako - ticket id 60252140 // Jonard Umerez commented privately: HI, i already send a lot of logs here in the case ticket that's why the client want also to have a remote session if it's possible",
      "Kayako - ticket id 60252140 // Andriy Rybalchenko commented publicly: Even though logs were shared before, we do need a scan results + fresh set after the previous log files were deleted to eliminate noise and concentrate on the current flow."

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There is a clear delay after the customer uploaded logs and requested updates multiple times; the agent later explicitly apologizes for the delayed response. The gap from the customer's log-upload note (Dec 3) to the next public staff response (Dec 10) is about 7 days.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although multiple messages include an auto-closure warning (\u201cticket will stay open for one week unless\u2026\u201d), there is no text indicating the ticket actually closed/auto-closed while the issue was unresolved.",
