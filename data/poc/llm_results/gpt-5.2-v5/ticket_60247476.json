    "detected": false,

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "After the customer stated they had already performed many of the requested checks and provided HAR files across environments, support continued to ask for the same types of browser/network tests.

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support introduced an auto-closure warning ('stay open for one week unless...') while the issue was still actively unresolved and being debated, which risks closing the ticket before resolution.",

Support did investigate (HAR review, WebSocket analysis) and later stated they were investigating on their side, so the evidence is insufficient to label this as clear high-severity mishandling.",
