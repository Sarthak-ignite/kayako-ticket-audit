    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI responses are repetitive and process-heavy, but they are coherent and tied to the reported symptoms (recurring unresponsive Web UI/WAN).

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "After the customer provided the serial number via attachment, support continued to request the serial number again, creating a loop where the customer indicates it was already provided. This fits the strong signal: customer says they already provided X and AI asks for the same X again.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer stated they provided the serial number in an attachment, but support repeatedly asked for it again rather than using what was provided (or clearly acknowledging it and moving forward). The customer explicitly pushed back that it was readable, indicating forced repetition.",
