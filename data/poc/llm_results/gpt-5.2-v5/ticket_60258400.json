    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The public ATLAS replies provide plausibly relevant troubleshooting steps (patch DB presence, connectivity, permissions, forced updates). There is no customer-facing statement that the AI guidance was wrong or useless, and no clearly broken/garbled AI template in public replies.",
    "evidence": [
      "ATLAS (public): \"Since the standard manual update process did not resolve the issue, here are further troubleshooting steps and verifications...\"",
      "ATLAS (public): \"Based on the information provided and the relevant knowledge base articles, here are the most targeted next steps and root causes to review...\""

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although there are multiple ATLAS public messages, a human agent (Keyur Saxena) does respond later. There is no customer-facing request for a human that is followed by 2+ additional AI-only customer-facing responses.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer provided logs earlier, but the later human response asks the customer to provide agent logs again rather than acknowledging/reviewing what was already sent. This indicates support is forcing repetition / not using provided context.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The visible response cadence does not show a 5+ day gap or multiple 3+ day gaps between a customer message and the next staff reply. The handoff from 2025-12-08 to 2025-12-09 is about one day.",

    "reasoning": "Support includes an auto-closure warning (\u201cstay open for one week unless\u2026\u201d) while the customer is still asking for log review and indicating unresolved urgency. This creates a risk of closure before resolution.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The ticket shows urgency around renewal timing, but it does not explicitly describe an outage/production-down scenario or label the issue as P1/SEV1/critical. Therefore there is insufficient evidence to assess mishandling of a high-severity incident.",
