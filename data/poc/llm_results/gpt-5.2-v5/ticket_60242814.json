    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The only AI content is in private/internal notes, and there\u2019s no customer-facing evidence that ATLAS provided incorrect, misleading, or broken guidance. The customer\u2019s complaint is about not receiving an answer, not that the AI answer was wrong.",

    "reasoning": "Support did not ask the customer to repeat previously provided details, and the agent\u2019s response explicitly references the customer\u2019s context (numbers were ported in and the plan to move in early summer 2026). No explicit customer complaint about being ignored/repeating information appears.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly followed up that they had not received an answer, and the agent apologized for the delay. This indicates a meaningful response gap before a clear reply was provided.",
