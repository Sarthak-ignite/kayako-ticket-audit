    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS content shown is mainly standard intake/clarification and does not contain an obvious broken template, incorrect guidance that is later corrected, or a customer complaint about the AI being wrong/useless. The only substantive customer-facing resolution guidance comes from the human agent.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no customer-facing pattern of repeated AI replies keeping the customer stuck, nor evidence the customer requested a human and then received multiple additional AI responses instead. A human agent ultimately replied publicly with next steps.",

    "detected": false,
