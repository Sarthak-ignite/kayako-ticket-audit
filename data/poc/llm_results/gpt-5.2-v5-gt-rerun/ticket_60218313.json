    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS initially provided fairly standard VSE troubleshooting, and when the customer said those steps were already done, ATLAS responded with a more detailed analysis and additional avenues (corruption/dependencies) rather than an obviously broken template or clearly incorrect guidance. There is no customer-facing statement that the AI responses were wrong/useless, and later human agents/engineering provided a concrete workaround and fix path.",
    "evidence": [
      "ATLAS (public): \"This issue usually indicates that one of the antivirus engines failed to load properly or is unable to update... The following steps are recommended\"",
      "Customer (public): \"Please note that all the suggested steps have already been completed. Unfortunately, these actions did not resolve the issue\"",
      "ATLAS (public): \"Below is a comprehensive overview and targeted guidance... The persistent 'Object reference not set...' error is generally attributed to a corrupted configuration, missing or problematic dependencies\""

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no customer-facing evidence that the customer requested a human and then received multiple subsequent AI-only replies. Publicly, named human agents (Aditi, Arafat, Raymond, Pablo) responded after the initial ATLAS messages.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although the customer stated the initial suggested steps were already done, support did not explicitly ask for the exact same steps again in a customer-facing way; subsequent requests were for additional/updated diagnostics (logs, event viewer exports, file versions). No customer-facing complaint appears that support ignored provided logs or information.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The interaction log does not show customer-facing long-silence follow-ups (e.g., 'any update' / waiting days) or explicit apologies for delay.

    "reasoning": "The ticket is closed per CSV, but the last customer-facing message requests further information from the customer after reviewing logs; the provided public record does not show the customer replying with unresolved concerns after that request. Without customer-facing evidence that the customer was still waiting on support at closure, premature closure is not supported.",
