  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS provided troubleshooting guidance that did not resolve the issue (e.g., keyboard shortcut), but it was phrased as a possible workaround rather than a definite fix, and there is no clear customer statement that the AI content was wrong/hallucinated. The thread also includes substantive human investigation of HAR/WebSocket behavior.",
    "evidence": [
      "ATLAS commented publicly: \"In the Response editor, agents can use the Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Return on Mac) keyboard shortcut to send a reply.\"",
      "Customer commented publicly: \"We have tested using Ctrl + Enter to send the message when the send button disappears, and there is no change.  It does not send the message, and a refresh is still required.\""

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer was not trapped in an AI-only loop; multiple human agents replied publicly throughout the interaction (e.g., Pavly, Rishi, Amir). There are not 3+ consecutive AI-only public messages and no explicit request for a human that was ignored.",
    "evidence": [
      "Pavly Nashed commented publicly: \"We are currently investigating this, and will get back to you shortly with further updates.\"",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly stated they had already performed the same troubleshooting (browsers, WFH vs office, provided HARs) and that the questions were repeats, yet support continued to request similar checks again. This indicates the customer was forced to repeat information/steps already provided.",

      "Don Kempt commented publicly: \"We have provided HAR\u2019s, we have checked with agents wfh and in office, used different browsers etc.\"",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The visible conversation shows same-day and next-day engagement from support, and there is no customer-facing follow-up like 'any update' after a long silence.

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The issue impacted agent workflow and was described as degraded service, but there is no explicit P1/SEV1/critical/outage designation in the customer-facing text. Support did perform HAR review and investigation rather than only giving generic troubleshooting with no escalation.",
