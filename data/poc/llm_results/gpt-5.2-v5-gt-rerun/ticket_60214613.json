    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no customer-facing evidence that ATLAS provided wrong/misleading guidance or that the customer complained about AI quality. The visible resolution work and explanations were provided by human agents.",

      "ATLAS commented privately: \"--- Ticket generated by StreetSmart AI chat ---\"",
      "Raymond Guirguis commented publicly: \"We identified that the issue was related to case sensitivity in the customer's email address during the automation process. This has now been resolved.\""

  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer was not stuck in an AI loop; human agents responded publicly and progressed the investigation. There is no request for a human followed by repeated AI-only responses.",

      "Shaquille De Lancy commented publicly: \"Dear Andrew, Thank you for contacting the StreetSmart Support Team...\"",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support did request additional details (e.g., affected email) after troubleshooting, but there is no explicit customer statement that support is making them repeat information already provided, nor repeated identical requests after the customer said they already provided it within the ticket.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No strong customer-facing signals of waiting/delay appear (no 'any update' after silence, no apology for delay), and the observed reply gaps in the thread are not 3+ days. Although the ticket lifetime is long in CSV, the interaction log does not show customer-facing delay impact.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer selected 'Urgent' in the (private) ATLAS transcript, but the ticket content does not show a production outage/SEV1 scenario (e.g., 'all users down'). Support engaged in targeted investigation and backend fixes rather than only generic troubleshooting.",
