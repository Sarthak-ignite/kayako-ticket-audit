    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no customer-facing evidence of long waiting/silence (e.g., 'any update' after days), and the timeline shows responses on the same day and the next day. CSV metrics alone are not sufficient without customer-facing signs of delay impact per the rubric.",
