  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support (AI manager) communicated that the vulnerability was \"fully resolved\" after Engineering upgraded Apache, but Engineering notes indicate the change still required development review/build/test/deploy before the vulnerability would be fully resolved for customers. This is misleading and overstates completion status.",
    "evidence": [
      "Kayako public (2025-11-13T13:02:20+00:00): \"...successfully upgraded the Apache version... effectively resolving the reported security vulnerability. This matter has been fully resolved.\"",
      "Engineering note (2025-11-13T13:00:18Z): \"Engineering has created pull request #3499... but the Development team needs to review, build, test, and deploy the changes before the security vulnerability is fully resolved.\"",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No evidence of the customer being trapped in repetitive AI interactions or requesting a human and being denied. The ticket shows a small number of AI updates and an engineering escalation.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There is a ~3-day gap between the initial acknowledgement/escalation and the next customer-facing update. Given the customer described this as a \"high security concern\" needing to be fixed ASAP, the absence of interim updates is a negative experience indicator.",

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support declared the issue \"fully resolved\" and indicated the linked engineering issue was closed, despite Engineering stating deployment steps were still pending (review/build/test/deploy). Closing/communicating resolution before delivery to customers is premature.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the customer described the issue as a high security concern, support did escalate to Engineering quickly and did not perform irrelevant troubleshooting. The main problem appears to be misleading closure/communication rather than lack of escalation.",
