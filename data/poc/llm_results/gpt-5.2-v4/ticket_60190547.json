    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS responses were largely template-like and did not meaningfully progress troubleshooting after the customer stated the steps were already done.

      "Customer: \"Followed steps, still same issues. The updates are failing every other hour or so\" (2025-09-06)",
      "ATLAS: provides standard delete-version-files/restart-services steps (2025-09-06) and then more manual-update steps after customer already said they did them (2025-09-08).",
      "Support message (later adopted by human, but originally drafted in internal note): \"Since you are receiving repeated failure notifications, this setting could be contributing to the unusually high volume of emails.\" (Ibiso internal draft 2025-09-18; repeated to customer by Randall 2025-09-18)"

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support repeatedly recommended steps the customer said were already performed, and later pivoted to an unrelated product installer/CDN explanation while the customer explicitly stated they were still waiting for an answer on failing AV updates. Customer also referenced continuing a prior ticket, but there\u2019s no visible acknowledgement/continuity handling in responses.",

      "Customer: \"I need to continue with Ticket #60163300\" (2025-09-06) \u2014 no visible acknowledgement/continuity handling in subsequent responses.",
      "Customer: \"I have already performed these steps\" (2025-09-08) yet support continues with similar manual update guidance rather than acknowledging what was tried and narrowing based on new data (2025-09-08).",
      "Customer: \"Still waiting on a response on failing updates.\" (2025-09-30 private) after support answered about v22.2 download/CDN propagation rather than the failing update issue (2025-09-29/2025-09-30)."

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the ticket contains auto-close language and an internal 'hold for 9999 hours' action, there isn\u2019t clear evidence that the ticket was actually closed with an outstanding customer request unanswered at the moment of closure (the log shows continued activity afterwards).",
