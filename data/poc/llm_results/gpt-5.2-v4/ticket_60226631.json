    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Customer repeatedly asked for RCA and prevention of recurrence. Support responses initially focused on acknowledgement/escalation and later on 'resolved' status without addressing the explicit request for root cause and recurrence prevention until the customer followed up again the next day. This indicates the stated customer need (RCA + prevention) wasn\u2019t addressed in the first resolution communication.",
