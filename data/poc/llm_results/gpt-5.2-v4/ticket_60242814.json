    "detected": false,

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support ultimately addressed the customer\u2019s specific questions (porting out feasibility, process, and fees) and referenced that numbers originally ported in are eligible. No clear instance of support re-asking already-provided details or disregarding previously stated constraints.",

      "Initial request: 2025-11-13T22:15:03+00:00 (customer asks about porting numbers back and any fee).",
      "Customer follow-up due to no answer: 2025-11-18T21:45:39+00:00 \u2014 \"Hello, I still have not received an answer to my question.\"",

      "Customer frames it as a future migration: \"In the early summer 2026 (next year) we will be migrating over to a new Zoom Phone phone system.\""
