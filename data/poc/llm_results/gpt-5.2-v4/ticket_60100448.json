This directly harmed customer trust and delayed resolution. ATLAS also initially offered speculative causes (disk space/corrupt download/hardware incompatibility) without concrete diagnostic steps or logs available on the appliance, and did not provide a clear path to obtain the missing Patch 2 image that the customer needed.",

      "ATLAS: \"Kerio Control Box NG110 appliances are supported up to version 9.4.x. The 9.5.0 release is not offered via automatic updates for NG110 hardware because this model is not officially supported for 9.5.0 and later versions.\"",
      "ATLAS: \"As of the latest available information, the Kerio Control Box NG110 series is not supported for Kerio Control version 9.5.0 or later.\"",

    "reasoning": "ATLAS did not fully incorporate the customer\u2019s core constraint: Patch 2 is offered by the appliance but the Patch 2 image is not available for manual download, blocking the suggested manual-upgrade path. ATLAS continued to focus on manual upgrade concepts (and version matching) without directly addressing how to obtain/apply Patch 2 for NG110 when it isn\u2019t published in the archive, which was the key practical blocker the customer highlighted.",
