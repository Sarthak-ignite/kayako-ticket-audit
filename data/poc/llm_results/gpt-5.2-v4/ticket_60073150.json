Instead, it defaulted to a generic \u201cupload logs\u201d flow and then a vague escalation (\u201cSend to engineering\u201d) without providing any substantive information, clarifying questions about the bug, or setting expectations for next steps/timeline. This is unhelpful for a known-release bug / version-fix inquiry.",
