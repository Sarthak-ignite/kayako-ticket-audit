    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ATLAS reply is largely generic firewall/NAT guidance and asserts a likely root cause (\u201cfirewall or network routing\u201d) despite the customer clearly reporting a version-specific regression (v10 breaks, downgrade fixes) with no config changes. The customer explicitly states the advice is not relevant, indicating the AI response did not address the core symptom (behavior changes only with version). The issue was later confirmed to be a known product incident, further suggesting the AI\u2019s diagnosis was misleading.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"update to v10 brakes it, downgrade to 9.5p3 fixes it. there are no config changes at all. Only version is chaning.\"",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS did not meaningfully incorporate key context already provided: that multiple security features were disabled without impact and that Kerio logs showed no issues. The AI still pushed generic steps (allow rules/ports/SSL inspection/NAT checks) without reconciling the version-only change the customer emphasized and without acknowledging the customer\u2019s statement that disabling those components did not help.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"the problem also occurred with all ips/geoip/antivirus/appfilter disabled.\"",
      "Customer: \"in kerio logs, there is no sign of any issue.\"",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There is a major gap (~31 days) between the customer\u2019s follow-up disputing the AI guidance and the next support response. This likely prolonged time-to-resolution, especially since the issue ultimately tied to a known incident.",
