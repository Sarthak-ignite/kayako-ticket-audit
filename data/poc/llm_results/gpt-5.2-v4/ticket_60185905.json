This reads like a generic knowledge-base template rather than analysis of the provided logs and the 1-hour recurrence pattern.",
    "evidence": [
      "\u201cthe debug log reveals the root cause: a critical LDAP connectivity failure occurs about one hour after Kerio Connect is restarted, indicated by the log: {ldapdb} Connections to LDAP servers were forbidden.\u201d",
