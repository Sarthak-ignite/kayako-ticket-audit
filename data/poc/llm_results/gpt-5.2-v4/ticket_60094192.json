    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "After the customer clearly states they will not use v22 and demands a fix in v21 for duplicate emails, internal handling continues to frame progress as blocked on logs (implicitly tied to prior reproduction/upgrade context) without acknowledging or adapting to the customer\u2019s new position (focus on v21).",
