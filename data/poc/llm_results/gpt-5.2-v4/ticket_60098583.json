    "reasoning": "The customer reported a functional problem (users cannot approve emails and see a specific message). The AI response shown does not address the symptom, provide troubleshooting steps, or even ask a targeted clarifying question; instead it pivots to license details, which appears generic/irrelevant to the immediate issue and risks slowing resolution.",

      "Customer: \"Users are not able to approve emails. They get a message that the email has been deleted or approved\"",

    "detected": false,
