The AI flow also failed to handle the customer-reported token/auth failure preventing uploads.",

This situation commonly occurs after hardware replacement, as the license file is bound to the specific hardware serial number...\" (generic diagnosis; does not address the customer\u2019s stated \"server is not responding\" / upload failure effectively)",
