    "reasoning": "The initial ATLAS reply was largely a generic \u201cknown issue\u201d deflection with no concrete mitigation, no verification steps, and it pointed the customer to a status page that did not reflect the incident. It also asserted specificity (\u201cparticularly for Kerio Connect units\u201d) without evidence in the ticket and did not address the customer\u2019s core concern (unit flagged offline for days while healthy). The customer explicitly called out the unhelpfulness of the status-page referral and lack of actionable guidance.",
