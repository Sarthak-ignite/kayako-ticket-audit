    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS responded with largely generic KB-driven troubleshooting after the customer explicitly stated that the KBs did not apply/solve the problem, and the main UI exception (\u201cObject reference\u2026\u201d) prevented using the very UI path ATLAS instructed. The responses did not meaningfully analyze the provided stack trace/error beyond restating it, and suggested actions that were not feasible (disable engines in UI) given the reported UI crash on that page.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer (private): \"Mr Dederding reports that none of the knowledge base entries (KBs) provided by ADN solved the problem or applied to his case.\"",
      "ATLAS: \"If the problem persists, temporarily disable the Virus Scanning Engines one by one in the MailEssentials configuration UI (under Email Security > Virus Scanning Engines)\"",
      "ATLAS (based on screenshots): \"an 'unexpected error' in the configuration interface, which prevents you from accessing email security/content filtering functions\" / \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\""

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There were two AI (ATLAS) public responses early, but the case then moved to human agents and engineering-provided workarounds/releases. The customer was not stuck in a prolonged AI-only loop, and escalation/human handling occurred later.",

      "ATLAS replied on 2025-10-10, then subsequent responses include named human agents (Aditi Garg, Arafat Bakhsh, Raymond Guirguis, Pablo Ambram)."

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support repeated troubleshooting despite the customer stating the steps were already completed, and suggested UI-based actions even though the customer\u2019s context showed the UI page fails to load with a null reference exception. This indicates incomplete incorporation of what the customer had already done and the constraints imposed by the UI error.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"Please note that all the suggested steps have already been completed. Unfortunately, these actions did not resolve the issue\" (2025-10-10 09:23).",
      "ATLAS earlier suggested: \"temporarily disable the Virus Scanning Engines one by one in the MailEssentials configuration UI\" while the screenshots/analysis stated: \"the affected page ... is not loaded\" and shows an exception when opening Information Store Protection/Virus scan engines.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There is at least one >=3-calendar-day gap while the customer was actively reporting ongoing impact and asking for direction/remote session. The customer followed up multiple times (15th/16th/17th) before the next substantive support response on the 18th.",
    "evidence": [
      "2025-10-15 09:54 (private): workaround only temporary + asks for clarification; next public support response is 2025-10-18 14:12.",
      "2025-10-16 11:10 (private): \"could we know when a technician would be available for a quick remote session?\" (no immediate reply shown).",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The issue impacted core security functionality (\u201cNo Mail Security\u201d / protection disabled for about a week). Despite explicit urgency and requests for a remote session, support continued with standard KB/upgrade/log-collection motions and did not promptly arrange interactive troubleshooting. Formal escalation appears only on 2025-10-20 after the customer escalated.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"The customer has been without email protection for about a week now, so we really need to get this issue fixed soon.\" (2025-10-16 / 2025-10-17).",
      "Escalation record: \"[customer_escalation] ... The customer message is: No Mail Security ... severity is: core_functionality_defect\" (2025-10-20 12:24).",
      "Before escalation acknowledgement, support response was primarily procedural: \"Please apply the steps ... to upgrade\" and \"If the issue persists, please enable tracing... provide logs\" (2025-10-18), rather than immediate high-touch/remote-session scheduling."
