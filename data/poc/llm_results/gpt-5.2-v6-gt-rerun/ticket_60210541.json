    "reasoning": "The ATLAS reply appears generic and prescriptive (ports/rules/SSL inspection) despite the customer clearly stating the issue is triggered only by upgrading to v10 and resolved by downgrading, with no config changes. The customer explicitly says the suggested steps are \u201cnot to the point,\u201d indicating the AI guidance was not effective or appropriately tailored.",

This indicates the response did not adequately incorporate key context already provided in the ticket.",
