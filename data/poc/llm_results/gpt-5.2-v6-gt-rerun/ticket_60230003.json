    "reasoning": "The AI conversation transcript appears incomplete/truncated and there is no visible troubleshooting or resolution captured before the ticket was closed almost immediately. This suggests a likely low-quality/failed AI interaction (at minimum, it did not deliver a usable outcome in the recorded exchange), though the truncation limits certainty about exactly what the AI responded.",
