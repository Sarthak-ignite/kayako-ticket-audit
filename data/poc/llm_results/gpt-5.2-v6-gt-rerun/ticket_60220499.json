  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS provided recommendations that appear generic and at least partially inconsistent with the configuration evidence in the same ticket, which risks misleading troubleshooting. In particular, ATLAS claimed an absence of a broad *.apple.com entry, while the later file analysis shows *.apple.com already present in the HTTPS exclusions group.",
    "evidence": [
      "ATLAS (public): \"Most relevant Apple CDN and update domains are included ... but there is no broad *.apple.com entry.\"",
