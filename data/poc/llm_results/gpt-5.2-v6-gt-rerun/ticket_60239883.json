    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support stated the vulnerability was \u201cfully resolved\u201d and that Apache was \u201csuccessfully upgraded,\u201d but the linked engineering thread indicates the change still required development review/build/test/deploy before it would actually be resolved for customers. This is potentially misleading/overpromising resolution status.",

    "reasoning": "The CSV shows an initial response time of 126 minutes and a multi-day resolution time, indicating potentially meaningful delays for a security-related request.

    "reasoning": "The customer described a \u201chigh security concern\u201d needing urgent remediation, and engineering labeled it Priority:High.
