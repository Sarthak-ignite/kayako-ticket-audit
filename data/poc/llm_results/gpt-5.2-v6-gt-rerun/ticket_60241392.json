    "reasoning": "ATLAS appears to have gotten stuck repeating an incorrect license key back to the customer instead of acknowledging the key the customer provided. The customer also reported the chatbot \u201ccrashes\u201d when trying to check the serial number, which indicates poor AI experience/handling. This is enough to flag AI quality issues even though the full chat transcript is truncated.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There are signs the workflow required the customer to re-provide/justify information that was already stated in the chat (e.g., video claimed uploaded, then requested again with specific attachment/link requirements). Also, ATLAS did not adapt to the customer-provided license key and continued using the on-record key, indicating missed context. Some of this may be process-driven, but it still reflects context not being effectively used.",

Given the customer\u2019s original request (RMA / non-booting firewall), closing without an explicit documented resolution to the customer is a reasonable risk indicator of premature closure (uncertain due to truncated later interactions).",

If the customer did not receive that corrective action promptly (not shown in public replies) and the ticket later closed, that would constitute mishandling; evidence is suggestive but incomplete due to truncated end-of-ticket communication.",
