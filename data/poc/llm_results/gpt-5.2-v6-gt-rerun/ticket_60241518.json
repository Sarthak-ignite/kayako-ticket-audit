  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated customer update appears template-driven and may be partially misaligned to the situation (generic request to enable logging/debugging and send logs) rather than addressing the immediate mitigation (cleaning existing accumulated directories) or giving concrete interim steps. It also makes a release-timing promise (\u201cnext weekend\u201d) that may be outside Support\u2019s control, which can be risky if the schedule slips. That said, it is directionally consistent with Engineering\u2019s note that the fix will be released soon, so confidence is moderate.",
