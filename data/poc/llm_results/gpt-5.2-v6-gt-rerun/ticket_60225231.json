    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support provided incorrect root-cause guidance by treating the AppManager error as a license incompatibility and directing the customer to Customer Care, later contradicted by an internal note stating this is a known/expected post-migration behavior fixed by resetting the AppManager agent. This misdiagnosis likely prolonged resolution and created unnecessary handoffs. There are also signs of low-quality/unsafe content (e.g., odd/fake-looking email address in instructions).",

    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly reports being bounced between channels (Customer Care \u2192 Atlas \u2192 Support \u2192 back to license/Customer Care), indicating a loop and difficulty reaching the right human team. The flow shows handoff to Customer Care even though the ultimate fix was a technical agent reset, reinforcing the 'ping-pong' experience.",

    "reasoning": "Despite the customer confirming connectivity (DNS/HTTPS access to appmanager.gfi.com) and providing logs, support still concluded the problem was the license being bound to old hardware and redirected the customer to Customer Care. This indicates they did not appropriately incorporate the already-shared troubleshooting results and evidence into the diagnosis. Some uncertainty remains because they did review logs, but the final conclusion ignored key context and was later corrected internally.",
