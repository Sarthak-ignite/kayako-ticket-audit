    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There is strong evidence that automated/AI-driven analysis produced incorrect claims (\"segmentation faults\"/\"firmware defect\") that engineering later stated had zero log evidence, explicitly calling it a hallucination. The customer also reported receiving templated/filler responses that felt non-human. Even after correction, guidance remained partly speculative (\"likely overwhelmed\"), indicating unreliable diagnostic quality.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly requested a human/live agent and repeatedly complained that support was still bot-operated.

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There are signals that support/automation did not fully incorporate already-provided context, leading to unnecessary gating questions and misdirected analysis. Engineering noted the bot focused on the wrong area due to keywords in the description (\"URL analysis\"), which indicates poor use of ticket context and produced a flawed path. Additionally, the agent later asked questions that were already largely answered in the initial description (upgrade timing/impact).",

Given recall-first, this is flagged as potential premature/pressure closure.",
