    "reasoning": "There are signals the customer experience was not getting adequate human engagement and wanted a named individual/phone call, plus an explicit request to stop AI responses.

The ticket is ultimately marked closed in CSV; given subsequent messages indicating ongoing issues/uncertainty, this raises risk of closure before confirmed resolution (some uncertainty because full end-of-ticket conversation is truncated).",
