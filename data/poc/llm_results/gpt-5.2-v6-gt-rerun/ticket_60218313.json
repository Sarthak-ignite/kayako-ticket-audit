    "reasoning": "ATLAS provided largely generic KB-style troubleshooting that the customer later stated had already been done, suggesting low adaptation to the case context. The early guidance also suggested using the UI to disable engines even though the ticket reported the UI section itself was throwing an exception and not loading, making parts of the advice potentially impractical. This is recall-first; while not definitively wrong, the quality appears mismatched and repetitive.",

    "reasoning": "Support continued with standard troubleshooting and KB references after the customer stated those steps were already completed.
