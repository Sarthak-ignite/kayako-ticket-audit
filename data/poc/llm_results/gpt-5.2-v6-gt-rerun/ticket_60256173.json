  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The automated agent outputs repetitive/templated content and appears to rely on OCR limitations as a blocker, leading to friction (customer insists the serial is readable). It also repeatedly requests extensive RMA artifacts (video, full details) even when the customer is dealing with a remote outage, which reads as low-adaptiveness and poor prioritization. Some conclusions (e.g., \u201cnot an obvious hardware failure\u201d) may be premature given recurring WAN/UI outages on a replacement unit, though this is partially process-driven.",

    "reasoning": "Support repeatedly asked for information that was either already provided (license confirmed; later shipping/contact details provided) or available from the prior RMA reference, creating unnecessary repetition. After the customer provided shipping/contact details, internal notes still flagged key address elements as missing (e.g., ZIP), suggesting the process did not adapt to the information already supplied. The serial-number back-and-forth also indicates the agent did not effectively use the provided attachment/context.",

    "reasoning": "The ticket is marked solved/closed in the CSV, but the visible conversation focuses on requesting more diagnostics/RMA info and does not show a clear confirmation of resolution or RMA completion.
