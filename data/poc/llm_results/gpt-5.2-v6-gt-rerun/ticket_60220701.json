    "reasoning": "The ATLAS interaction shown is largely boilerplate (generic prompts, file-upload push) and does not demonstrate meaningful troubleshooting or adaptation to the stated issue.

    "reasoning": "The customer was able to get human-agent responses and schedule a meeting; the thread does not show the customer being trapped in an AI loop or repeatedly blocked from reaching a person.

    "reasoning": "There is a long gap between ticket creation (Oct 14) and the first substantive agent response (Oct 22).
