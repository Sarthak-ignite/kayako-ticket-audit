While not all content is explicitly AI-generated, CentralSupport automation (ai-acc/ATLAS) appears involved and contributed to a suboptimal experience.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly reported recurring incidents and asked whether the fix would prevent recurrence; responses acknowledged impact but did not directly confirm whether a specific corrective action was implemented to stop recurrence or reference prior ticket history.
