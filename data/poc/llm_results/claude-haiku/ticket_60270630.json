There's insufficient context to definitively assess any of the quality issues. A more complete ticket transcript would be needed for a comprehensive analysis.\n\nKey observations:\n- Ticket status is closed\n- Priority is normal\n- No detailed support interactions are visible\n- Time to first human response is not available (nan)\n\nTo properly evaluate these quality patterns, I would need:\n1. Full conversation transcript\n2. Detailed interactions between support and customer\n3. More context about the initial support request",
