The AI responses are particularly problematic, with truncated messages and repetitive language.\n2. There's a clear AI wall where the system seems to be stuck in a loop of asking for clarification.\n3. Despite these issues, the ticket appears to be tracking a specific technical issue about page refreshing in the Khoros community platform.\n4. The ticket does not show signs of critical mishandling, but the AI interaction quality is notably poor.",
