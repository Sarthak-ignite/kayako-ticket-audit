The ticket shows significant communication gaps\n2. The customer's core request about accessing historical ticket attachments was not fully resolved\n3. Multiple AI automation comments added no substantive value\n4. The ticket was closed prematurely without addressing the customer's original concern\n5. Long response times (667 hours) indicate poor support responsiveness",
