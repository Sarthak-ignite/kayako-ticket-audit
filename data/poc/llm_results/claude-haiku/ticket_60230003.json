The ticket context shows a normal priority\n2. Time to first human is marked as 'nan'\n3. Max response gap is 0.0 hours\n4. The interaction appears to be an AI-generated summary/wrap-up message\n5. Most of the ticket details and actual customer interaction are missing\n\nTo provide a more accurate quality assessment, I would need:\n- Complete customer interactions\n- Full conversation transcript\n- More context about the support request",
