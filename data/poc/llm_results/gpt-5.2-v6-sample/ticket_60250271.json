While ATLAS did not provide customer-facing guidance in this thread (it mostly skipped), the customer experience described indicates AI support quality issues outside/around this ticket flow.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"She has already created tickets before and either they did not get created/no response/ or AI chatbot response that was not helpful\"",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer reports difficulty getting support through normal channels, including tickets not being created, no response, and being routed to an unhelpful or unavailable chatbot. This suggests friction reaching effective human support and potential looping through automated/self-serve pathways.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Some responses appear to partially dismiss or under-weight the customer\u2019s prior incident history and symptoms by emphasizing \"no changes\" and implying the issue is solely on the customer side, even though the issue had recurred and the customer described a specific cross-product (Care vs Marketing) switching pattern. This is somewhat indirect, but there is enough evidence to suspect context was not fully incorporated early in the thread.",
    "evidence": [
      "Agent: \"I can confirm that the issue was previously resolved under case #60237228, and there have been no changes on the Khoros side...\"",
      "Agent: \"To be clear: we did not apply any fix on our end during the last incident. The issue was resolved solely due to adjustments made by Briamel on their side\"",
