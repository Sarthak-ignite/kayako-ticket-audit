    "reasoning": "There are signs of low-quality/automated AI handling: the issue description is duplicated multiple times in the ticket creation, and early ATLAS replies are generic/speculative (permissions/DCOM/SQL) without clearly tying to the customer\u2019s specific symptoms (no Activity Monitor entries). The eventual fix appears to come later from a human agent via a specific KB article, suggesting the AI guidance may not have been the most direct path (uncertain).",
