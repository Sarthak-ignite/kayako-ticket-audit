    "reasoning": "The guidance around required connectivity appears inconsistent: early instructions emphasize allowing ports 80 and 443 and testing HTTP, while later internal guidance states HTTP/80 is not required. This can mislead the customer into changing firewall rules unnecessarily (they explicitly planned to open HTTP).",

    "reasoning": "The ticket is marked closed in the CSV, but the visible conversation content centers on waiting for AM authorization and troubleshooting, with no clear final customer-confirmed resolution shown in the provided excerpt.
