  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer reports difficulty opening tickets via the portal and that the support phone number did not help, but there is no direct indication they were trapped in an AI chat loop or repeatedly blocked by an AI system. This appears to be an access/support-channel issue rather than an AI wall.",

      "Customer: \"we are currently unable to open a new ticket through the support portal. we\u2019re receiving an error\"",

    "detected": true,

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence of a meaningful response delay within this ticket; the lifecycle is effectively instantaneous per the CSV.

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket was solved and closed within seconds of being created, even though the customer is actively requesting help to reopen/escalate an unresolved prior case and cannot open new tickets.

    "reasoning": "The customer describes a support-access problem and a prior unresolved technical issue, but there is no clear indication of a production outage, safety/security incident, or explicitly stated critical business impact requiring P1/Sev1 handling. Severity/urgency signals are insufficient to label this as Sev1 mishandling.",
