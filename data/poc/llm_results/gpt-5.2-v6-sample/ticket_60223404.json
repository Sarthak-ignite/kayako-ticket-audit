It also introduces an \u201cemergency\u201d framing and \u201cone additional week\u201d policy language that reads template-like rather than tailored to the reported production-impacting symptom.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly pushes back on the self-service/AI flow and requests that an agent log the ticket, indicating friction reaching a human. The interaction shown is entirely ATLAS-driven with no visible handoff to a live agent despite the customer\u2019s stated expectation.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket lifecycle indicates a long time to resolution/closure (about a week) which is significant given the report involves intermittent 500 errors impacting all users. Even if the first response was fast, the overall resolution time suggests delays in meaningful progress.",

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS states the ticket will remain open only one week unless the customer replies with explicit closure language, which can drive auto-closure independent of true resolution. The ticket is marked closed in CSV, and there is no customer confirmation of resolution in the provided interaction history, so premature/auto closure is plausible (uncertain due to missing later messages).",
