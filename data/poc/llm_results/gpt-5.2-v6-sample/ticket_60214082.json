There is no explicit customer request for a human in the provided excerpt, so this is flagged based on the gating behavior and lack of shown handoff.",

    "reasoning": "After the customer clearly states the issue (multi-server setup broken after upgrade; cannot set slave server), the AI does not acknowledge or use those details to ask targeted diagnostic questions and instead changes course to license verification.
