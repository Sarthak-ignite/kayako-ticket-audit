    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated customer update appears consistent with the engineering outcome (fix planned for an upcoming release) and does not contain obvious incorrect technical guidance or broken promises within the ticket record. While it includes a generic request to enable logs if the issue persists, that is not clearly misleading given the context.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly requested escalation to Engineering early, but the first explicit acknowledgment/escalation message appears much later, suggesting the request/context may not have been acted on promptly. This may overlap with response delay, but from a recall-first lens it also indicates possible failure to engage with the customer\u2019s stated request in a timely way.",

    "reasoning": "The customer reported disk consumption that could block firmware updates (\u201cblock Exinda from successful update\u201d), which can be high-impact, and the handling shows a long delay before escalation/response. Severity is not explicitly labeled P1/Sev1, so this is flagged with some uncertainty, but the potential impact plus slow handling is consistent with possible high-severity mishandling.",
