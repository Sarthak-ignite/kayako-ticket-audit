    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence in the provided excerpt that the customer was stuck in a loop or asked for a human, nor that the AI refused escalation. The conversation is truncated, so looping could have occurred later, but it\u2019s not supported by the visible text.",

    "reasoning": "The customer clearly reports a UI/feature failure (filters not responding; 404 on Details), but the next visible AI message focuses on license-key confirmation rather than acknowledging the specific symptoms or asking targeted diagnostic questions.
