  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI interaction appears generic and potentially misaligned to the user, starting with an \"internal employees\" menu and boilerplate content rather than addressing an actual issue. While not provably incorrect, this can indicate low-quality or poorly targeted AI handling (uncertain due to limited transcript).",
    "evidence": [
      "\u201cWelcome to the menu for internal employees.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlease note: The AI Support Agent is very smart and helpful, but like any GenAI assistant, he may provide incorrect responses from time to time.\u201d"

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The transcript shows a short intake flow (raise ticket \u2192 priority \u2192 request instance URL) with no evidence of repeated looping, refusal to route to a human, or the customer asking for a human.",
    "evidence": [

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no clear instance of support ignoring information already provided; the AI asked for the instance URL, and the customer had not provided it in the visible content.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket stayed open for ~1 hour 36 minutes (resolutionTime=5792 seconds). Given the customer selected High priority, this could indicate a meaningful delay/slow handling, though there are no explicit customer complaints (uncertain).",

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket was closed shortly after creation with no visible troubleshooting, resolution, or confirmation from the customer that the issue was solved. This strongly suggests closure occurred before the customer\u2019s need was addressed.",
