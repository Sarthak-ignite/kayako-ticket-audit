  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI response appears misaligned with the customer\u2019s request (changing fault priority), instead pivoting to license information. This suggests the AI did not provide a direct, actionable path to update the priority and may be delivering irrelevant content.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no clear evidence the customer was trapped in an AI loop, repeatedly re-prompted, or explicitly asked for a human. The excerpt shows only a single customer request and a single AI reply.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly asked to change fault priority to High, but the AI immediately responded with license details rather than acknowledging or executing the priority-change request. This indicates failure to use/acknowledge the provided context.",

    "reasoning": "The ticket was closed almost immediately after creation, and the visible conversation does not show the customer\u2019s request being fulfilled or confirmed. This strongly suggests closure occurred before ensuring the customer\u2019s need (priority change) was resolved.",
