    "reasoning": "The agent response is very generic and provides no actionable troubleshooting or verification steps, then asserts the issue was a \u201ctest-triggered incident\u201d and that normal functionality \u201cshould\u201d be available without showing any validation with the customer. This could be correct (engineering said it was test-triggered), but from a customer-support quality standpoint it risks being misleading/low-value if the customer still can\u2019t download patches.",

      "\u201cThank you for your patience. We have contacted the Engineering team and will inform you as soon as we receive further details from them.\u201d",

    "reasoning": "The customer provided problem description and urgency, but support did not acknowledge key details (error shown, console unresponsive, verified network connectivity) with any targeted follow-up questions or steps; they only gave a generic escalation update. This can indicate weak use of the context already provided, even if escalation was appropriate.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \u201cWe have verified that all network connectivity is functioning correctly\u2026 when we initiate the patch download, the screen becomes unresponsive\u2026 and the error shown below appears.\u201d",

    "reasoning": "CSV shows non-trivial time metrics (initialResponseTime and resolutionTime) and the ticket remained open/closed over multiple days, which can indicate delays in closure cycle. Even though the first public response appears quick in the timeline, the CSV and closure timing suggest potential delay signals.",

    "reasoning": "The ticket is marked closed, but there is no customer confirmation that patch downloads succeeded after the \u201ctest-triggered\u201d explanation. Closing without explicit validation can be premature, especially for a functional outage-like symptom (patch downloads failing).",
