  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS responded to a billing/payment-reminder issue with generic troubleshooting prompts about uploading logs/screenshots, which appears irrelevant and unhelpful for the described finance inquiry. This suggests low-quality/templated AI behavior rather than a targeted billing support flow.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"received a mail about billing not being received\"",
      "ATLAS: \"If you have any \ud83d\udcc3 log files or \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f screenshots to upload to help with the troubleshooting, now is the time to do it \ud83d\udcaa\""

    "detected": false,

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There is a long gap between ticket creation (Sep 30) and the first substantive human response (Oct 28), suggesting a significant response delay. The overall resolution time in CSV is also very large, reinforcing slow handling.",
