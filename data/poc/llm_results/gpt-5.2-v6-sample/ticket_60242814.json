    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ATLAS interaction appears to respond with generic troubleshooting prompts (requesting logs/screenshots) despite the customer asking an administrative/billing/porting policy question. This suggests the AI did not adapt well to the request context, though the transcript is truncated so certainty is moderate.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no clear evidence the customer was trapped in an AI loop or requested a human and was blocked. The ticket moved to an L1 agent workflow and was answered by a human agent.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI appears to ignore the nature of the customer\u2019s porting/fee question by asking for troubleshooting artifacts (logs/screenshots), which are not relevant to the request. This is a light/partial form of ignoring context; the human agent later addressed the question directly.",

    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly reported they still had not received an answer days after creating the ticket, and the substantive response appears to come much later. The CSV also shows a very long initial response time and overall resolution time, reinforcing significant delays.",
