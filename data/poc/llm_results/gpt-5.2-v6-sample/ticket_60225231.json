    "reasoning": "ATLAS appears to respond with largely generic/possibly irrelevant content (active incident list) rather than addressing the stated license registration failure. Additionally, the case shows a likely AI-assisted misdiagnosis (treated as a license/customer-care issue) that was later corrected internally as a known/expected behavior requiring an AppManager agent reset (suggesting earlier guidance was misleading).",

    "reasoning": "The customer experience suggests being bounced between channels (Customer Care \u2192 ATLAS \u2192 Support \u2192 back to Customer Care), which can feel like an AI wall/loop even if humans later engaged. The customer explicitly references being sent to ATLAS and then redirected again, indicating difficulty getting direct, correct help initially.",

    "reasoning": "Support initially anchored on license invalidity/hardware-binding despite the customer providing logs and confirming DNS/outbound connectivity and that appmanager.gfi.com was reachable via tools.
