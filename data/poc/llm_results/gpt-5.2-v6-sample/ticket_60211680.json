    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS appears to provide incorrect or low-quality guidance: it reported zero licenses/seats while internal notes indicate the company had many devices, and it failed to understand a clear request for a representative. This suggests misleading automation that did not properly reflect the account state or user intent.",

This suggests a mismatch/possible failure to incorporate the customer\u2019s stated context (ownership/access) before requesting action.",
