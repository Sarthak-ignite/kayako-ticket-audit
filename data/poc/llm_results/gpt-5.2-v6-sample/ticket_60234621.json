    "reasoning": "The customer reports inability to start chats due to the widget/page not loading, which appears to be a service outage rather than being stuck in an AI bot loop. There is no explicit request to bypass AI or reach a human agent, and the ticket includes human-agent updates.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly complains about waiting (\u201cpast 35 minutes\u201d without chat). Additionally, the CSV shows a very long resolution time (several days), suggesting extended time-to-resolution/closure in the ticket lifecycle even though a fix was implemented quickly.",
