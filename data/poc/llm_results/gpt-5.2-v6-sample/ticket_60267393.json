The second ATLAS reply mostly repeats the first, which can be experienced as filler rather than progress toward resolution.",

      "ATLAS: \"As a recap, the difference in conversation visibility... is most commonly related to differences in Smart View assignments, work queue selections, or filtering/sorting settings...\"",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no indication the customer struggled to reach a human, asked for escalation to a person, or got trapped in a repeated back-and-forth AI loop. The customer paused troubleshooting due to PTO rather than complaining about the support channel.",

      "ATLAS: \"Thank you for reaching out and for providing detailed screenshots illustrating the queue discrepancy between your agent view and your colleague's.\"",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket remained open for an extended period (about 10\u201313 days from creation to solve/close), suggesting meaningful delay before resolution/closure. Even though the customer noted PTO, the long resolution/closure timings are still present in the record.",

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket was solved/closed without any explicit customer confirmation that the issue was resolved; the last customer message said they could not troubleshoot until after the holidays. This creates a reasonable risk that the case was closed while the customer still needed help (uncertain, but supported by the interaction timeline).",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The issue impacts an agent\u2019s ability to see conversations, but the ticket text does not indicate an outage, broad service failure, or explicit urgent/P1 severity. There is insufficient evidence that a high-severity incident required escalation and was mishandled.",
