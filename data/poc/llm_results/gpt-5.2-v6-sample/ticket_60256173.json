  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The automated/AI-driven responses appear template-heavy and repetitive, repeatedly requesting the same RMA checklist despite the customer\u2019s constraints (remote site) and already-provided details. There is also a mismatch between what the customer says (serial clearly readable) and the AI response insisting it cannot read it, which degrades perceived quality. While some of this may be tooling/OCR limits, the interaction shows poor adaptation to the situation.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"This in unacceptable. The unit is located remote and we cannot drive there every week to do some HW diagnostics tools.\"",
      "AI public reply: \"To proceed with warranty verification and a potential RMA, we kindly request the following details: ... Serial number ... A video recording ... Company name ... Contact phone number ... Shipping address...\"",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support repeatedly asks for information already provided/confirmed (e.g., license key) and continues to demand the serial number in a typed format even after the customer supplied photos and stated it was readable. The customer also indicated shipping should be the same as the prior ticket, yet support continues to request full shipping/contact details again, indicating the prior context wasn\u2019t leveraged.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket is marked closed in the CSV, but the provided interaction log does not show a clear customer-confirmed resolution or closure confirmation.

    "reasoning": "The customer reports an outage condition (WAN down, no VPN access, users unable to reach the internet) which is consistent with a high-severity incident. Despite marking the ticket urgent, support focuses heavily on RMA intake requirements (video, full shipping checklist) and longer-cycle steps (factory reset/system recovery) rather than a clear immediate outage stabilization/escalation path; this may represent suboptimal handling for a site-down scenario.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"The webUI was unresponsive, WAN was not working - no VPN connection from our side and clients in the office could not reach the internet via WAN.\"",
      "Customer: \"Unit failed today about 08:30.\"",
