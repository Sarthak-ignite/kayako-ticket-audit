    "reasoning": "ATLAS\u2019s guidance appears partially misaligned with the customer\u2019s stated goal (a new G2 license), prompting for logs/screenshots and a broad troubleshooting-style intake rather than focusing on license-transfer requirements. While it later asks for an authorization form and license/server details, the initial steps look like generic filler and may slow the path to the correct workflow (license issuance).",
