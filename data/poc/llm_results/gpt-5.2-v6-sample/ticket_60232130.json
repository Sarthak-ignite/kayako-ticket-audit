Engineering explicitly states the earlier claim about thousands of collectord segfaults was a hallucination with no log evidence, and the agent later told the customer the initial diagnosis was incorrect. This qualifies as poor AI quality because it drove an erroneous root-cause narrative and escalation.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly requested a human/live agent due to business critical impact, but the chat indicated agents were unavailable and proceeded with ticket creation instead. The customer repeatedly questioned whether they were still dealing with a chatbot rather than real support, indicating an AI-wall experience.",

    "reasoning": "There are signs the support flow did not effectively incorporate prior context: the customer provided extensive details early (versions, model, CPU 100%, collectord) yet later the agent asked basic questions about why the upgrade was performed and whether there were errors during upgrade. This may be normal troubleshooting, but given the volume of already-provided narrative and repeated customer frustration about canned responses, it suggests some context was not fully leveraged.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer (initial description): \"CPU utilization at 100%... Notice the high CPU as soon upgraded to v7.6.3\"",
      "Customer: \"So many responses from your replies are saying \\\"feedback and the information you have shared will be carefully reviewed...\\\"\"",
