Because the transcript is truncated, the full extent is unclear, but the visible response already indicates a mismatch.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly indicates they did not get a conversation with a human agent and is questioning closure, which is consistent with being stuck in an AI-only flow or difficulty reaching a human.

    "reasoning": "The AI\u2019s visible reply does not acknowledge the customer\u2019s stated issue (ticket closure without human response) and instead pivots to license-key information, indicating it ignored the immediate context provided. The truncation adds uncertainty, but the shown turn already demonstrates context-miss behavior.",
