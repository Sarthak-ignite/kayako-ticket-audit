    "reasoning": "There is some evidence the AI intake (ATLAS) produced a low-value, boilerplate-heavy handoff that did not capture actionable technical detail (e.g., environment, exact error text, affected versions), which may have contributed to a slow/iterative troubleshooting start. This is weaker evidence because most later guidance comes from human agents, but the AI transcript shows limited progress beyond prompting and ticket creation.",
