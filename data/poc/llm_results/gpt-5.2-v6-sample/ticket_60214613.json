    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support initially referenced an opportunity link from the ticket intake, but the requester later had to correct it, suggesting earlier work may have been anchored to the wrong record. Later, one agent advised cache/cookies clearing, while an internal note indicates the root cause likely wasn\u2019t cache-related (mapping/case-sensitivity), which can reflect insufficient use of already-available internal context.",
