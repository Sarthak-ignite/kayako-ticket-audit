This makes the initial AI guidance at least partially misleading for the customer\u2019s situation. There are also explicit requests to stop AI responses, suggesting the AI output quality was not meeting expectations.",
    "evidence": [
      "ATLAS (public): \"we observed multiple telemetry and tracking requests\u2014primarily from monitoring scripts like New Relic ... which are creating frequent background XHR and image beacon requests... can contribute to client-side congestion and UI lag\"",

    "reasoning": "Support (ATLAS) continued focusing on third\u2011party trackers even after the customer clarified they only run the BrandMessenger script and reported reproduction in incognito (reducing the likelihood of extensions being the cause). The customer also pointed to a similar prior incident and asked for infrastructure escalation, indicating key context had to be repeated/was not effectively incorporated at first.",
