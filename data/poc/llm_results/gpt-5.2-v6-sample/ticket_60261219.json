    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI did not address the customer\u2019s actual technical request (VPN over IPv6) and instead pivoted immediately to requesting a license key, which is not a direct or helpful next step for the stated goal. This suggests low-quality/help-avoidant behavior or poor relevance to the question (at least in the visible portion of the interaction).",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"i want a VPN Connection over ipv6 (open SSL or Kerio VPN)\"",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "In the provided excerpt, there is no clear evidence the customer was unable to reach a human, asked for a human, or got stuck in a repetitive AI loop. The AI even states it can connect the customer to a specialist if it can\u2019t resolve the issue, but we cannot confirm whether that happened due to truncation.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer clearly stated the desired outcome (VPN over IPv6), but the AI response did not acknowledge or engage with IPv6/VPN feasibility, configuration, or constraints and instead requested a license key. This indicates the AI did not use the context already provided to move troubleshooting forward.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There are no visible customer complaints about waiting and no clear large response gaps shown in the excerpt. The overall ticket lifecycle appears relatively short (about 1.8 hours) based on CSV timestamps, which does not strongly indicate a delay issue.",

  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The ticket is marked closed very quickly after creation, and the only visible interaction shows the customer asking for a specific capability while the AI asks for a license key rather than providing an answer. Because the conversation is truncated and we cannot see a resolution or confirmation from the customer, there is a reasonable concern the ticket may have been closed without fully addressing the request.",
