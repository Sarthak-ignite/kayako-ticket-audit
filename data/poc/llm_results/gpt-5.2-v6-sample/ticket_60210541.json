    "reasoning": "The ATLAS reply appears largely generic (standard port/NAT/SSL inspection guidance) and does not engage with the customer\u2019s core claim that the issue is version-dependent (v10 breaks, downgrade fixes) with no config changes. The customer explicitly states the proposed steps are \u201cnot to the point,\u201d indicating the AI response was not useful for the scenario described.",
    "evidence": [
      "ATLAS: \"Based on the log details provided\u2014especially the timeout... The most likely root cause relates to firewall or network routing...\"",
      "ATLAS: \"Verify that port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) are accessible from the internet...\"",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no clear indication the customer was trapped in an AI-only loop or repeatedly requested a human and was denied. The customer did not ask for escalation to a person; a human agent later responded.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The initial response focused on firewall/NAT/port accessibility as if this were a standard external reachability issue, while the customer had already provided strong context that the same setup works on 9.5 SP3 and fails only after upgrading to v10 with no config changes and security features disabled. This suggests the response did not sufficiently acknowledge or incorporate key context already provided.",
    "evidence": [
      "Customer: \"after a downgrade to 9.5 SP3 it will solved.\"",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the agent mentioned an auto-close policy (\u201cstay open for one week\u201d), the customer then confirmed the issue was solved and agreed it could be considered resolved. Closure appears consistent with customer confirmation rather than premature closure while unresolved.",
