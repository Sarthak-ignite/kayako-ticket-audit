  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The provided ticket content is an introductory AI message thanking the user and indicating a chat record. There is no substantive AI reply shown that is generic, factually wrong, or containing broken promises, so there is insufficient evidence to label this as an AI quality failure.",
    "evidence": []
  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no conversation history showing repeated AI prompts, repeated requests, or the customer being unable to reach a human. The fragment does not indicate looping behavior.",
    "evidence": []
  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The ticket excerpt does not include any instance where the support agent asks for information the customer already provided. No repeated requests for logs or ignored details are present in the supplied content.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Only a single timestamped AI comment is provided (2025-08-07T13:09:02+00:00). There is no multi-day gap between interactions shown in the snippet, so there is no evidence of significant response delays.",

  },
  "PREMATURE_CLOSURE": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The excerpt does not show the ticket being closed while the customer is waiting for promised information or the customer abandoning the ticket. No closure or customer follow-up is present.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no indication that this ticket was marked P1/SEV1 or that a high-priority issue received only generic troubleshooting rather than escalation. The provided content does not include priority or troubleshooting details.",
