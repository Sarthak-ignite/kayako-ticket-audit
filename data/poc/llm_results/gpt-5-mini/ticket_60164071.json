  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Automated/AI actions in the thread show low-quality or inappropriate behaviour: an AI placed the ticket on hold for an implausible duration (9999 hours) and an AI comment changed a JIRA to 'Closed' without documented human RCA completion. There are also terse AI/private messages rather than substantive answers (e.g. placings on hold and forced state changes), which amount to generic or procedural responses rather than helpful investigation.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The log shows engineering reviewed HAR files and asked for more recent conversation examples, and notes about inability to reproduce; there is no clear instance of support repeatedly asking for the exact same logs or otherwise ignoring information the customer already provided.",

    "reasoning": "The customer and internal messages indicate a Showstopper / high-impact incident where the customer demanded an RCA, yet the issue was treated as not a Sev-1/outage, engineering could not reproduce, and an RCA was not provided. The handling appears to downplay the customer's severity and relies on standard triage rather than clear expedited escalation or a delivered RCA.",
