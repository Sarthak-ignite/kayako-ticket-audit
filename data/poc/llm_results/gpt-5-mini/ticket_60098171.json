    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The interaction log shows the customer repeatedly reporting the same symptoms and frustration while the AI posts repeated, similar templated messages. The customer states they are 'out' and complains about being told the same replies, indicating they feel stuck in a loop and not escalated to a human.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The AI replies are generic and do not demonstrate acknowledgement or use of the specific troubleshooting details the customer provided (e.g., SMTP queue, Failed (VSE) errors, reinstalling). The customer repeatedly describes specific steps and observations, but AI replies remain templated and do not appear to build on that context.",

      "Customer: \"Reinstalled and first thing that occurs is the Failed VSE.... Was not a clean install\"",
