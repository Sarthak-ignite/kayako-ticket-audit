  "AI_QUALITY_FAILURES": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "AI (ATLAS) responses in the thread are generic and filler-like (transcript dump and a single 'Action: Send to engineering') rather than providing substantive troubleshooting or clear next steps. This suggests low-quality AI output in this ticket.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no clear sign the customer was trapped in repeated AI exchanges requesting the same information. The log shows the AI escalated ('Send to engineering') and human employees subsequently posted multiple comments.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no explicit instance of support asking the customer to re-submit logs or otherwise asking for information already provided. The messages visible are queries about fixes and version confirmation, not repeated requests for the same attachments or logs.",

      "[2025-06-13T13:30:57+00:00] (Employee) Ian DeMoss: Can you confirm that the 7.6.0 version fixes the \u2018no policy\u2019 bug...",

    "evidence": [
      "Interactions reference confirming whether version 7.6.0 fixes a 'no policy' bug, but no priority/severity flag is shown.",
      "AI action was 'Send to engineering', which is an escalation rather than generic troubleshooting."
