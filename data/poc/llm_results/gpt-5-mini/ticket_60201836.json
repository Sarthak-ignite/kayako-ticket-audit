      "Centralsupport-ai-acc/bot placed the ticket 'on hold for 9999 hour(s)', which is an unreasonable automated action and indicates poor AI handling (2025-10-23T07:29:02+00:00 and 2025-10-23T07:23:02+00:00)."

    "evidence": [
      "Customer provided video/details earlier (2025-09-19) and support referenced the known-architecture issue and raised to engineering rather than repeatedly requesting the same logs.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Agent closed the ticket stating no actions left on Support side, but engineering indicated this is a known architectural issue in progress (re-architecture), and the customer earlier stated they expected a resolution or steps to follow. Closing while the underlying engineering fix is in progress suggests premature closure without customer-facing resolution.",
