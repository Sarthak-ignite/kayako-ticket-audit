    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No clear, unambiguous evidence that ATLAS provided factually incorrect product information, made a specific promise that was not delivered, used a broken template (e.g., addressing itself), or gave irrelevant troubleshooting. The responses are mostly log-collection and configuration-focused guidance that plausibly relates to scheduled scan issues.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "ATLAS requests the same diagnostic logs multiple times in the same ticket, despite the customer indicating extensive prior troubleshooting and referencing an existing partner ticket with information. This creates a loop where the customer is repeatedly pushed back to provide diagnostics rather than receiving escalation or a next-step action plan.",
    "evidence": [
      "[2025-09-09T11:06:55+00:00] ATLAS: \"please provide... GFI LanGuard diagnostic logs from both the affected machine(s) and the LanGuard console.\"",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Although ATLAS repeats requests for diagnostics, it does acknowledge the referenced partner ticket and explicitly offers a way to avoid duplicating uploads by asking for the upload date/time. This prevents a clear, unambiguous finding that ATLAS ignored context.",
    "evidence": [
      "[2025-09-09T11:15:01+00:00] ATLAS: \"If your partner has already uploaded these under ticket 60166415, please confirm the upload date/time so we can locate and use the same data internally, avoiding duplication.\""

    "reasoning": "No customer-to-support gap of 3+ calendar days is shown. Support responses occur the same day (minutes later) and on 2025-09-16 ATLAS responds within about a minute.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "The customer explicitly requests an urgent priority due to 'extreme business loss' and describes a large-scale enterprise/banking impact (300+ endpoints). The support response remains largely standard (request logs, mention one-week open/auto-close language) with no visible escalation path, ownership, or urgent-handling steps reflected in the replies.",
