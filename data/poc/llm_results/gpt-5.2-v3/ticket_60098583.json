There is no visible AI troubleshooting guidance or conclusion to evaluate for factual incorrectness, irrelevance, broken templates, or unfulfilled promises. The ticket content is explicitly truncated, so there is insufficient evidence to confirm an AI quality failure.",

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "There is no evidence the customer requested a human, nor any repeated requests by AI for the same information. Only the initial prompt and the customer's first description are visible.",

      "No customer request for human assistance is shown in the excerpt.",
      "Only one customer problem description is shown; no repeated AI questioning is visible due to truncation."

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The excerpt does not show support (AI or human) asking for information the customer already provided, nor does it show the customer indicating they already explained or already tried steps. With the conversation truncated, there is no clear, unambiguous instance of context being ignored.",
