    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No clear, unambiguous evidence that ATLAS provided factually incorrect product information, made unfulfilled promises, used broken templates, or gave irrelevant troubleshooting.

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support asked for artifacts that the customer had already indicated they had (watchdog dump/logs), and did not address the customer\u2019s primary request to analyze the already-available dump/logs. This is reinforced by the customer explicitly calling out that support did not analyze prior dump/logs and asking whether they were reviewed.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "While the issue impacts connectivity (\"internet was unavailable for approx. 4 minutes\"), the ticket is not explicitly marked P1/SEV1/Critical, and the support actions requested (dumps/support info/dmesg, monitoring after patch) are not clearly inappropriate or irrelevant for repeated service crashes.",
