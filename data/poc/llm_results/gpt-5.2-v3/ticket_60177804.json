    "detected": false,

  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer requests a meeting/human assistance, and humans respond (Pablo, Shaquille, Carlos). There is no sequence of repeated AI requests for the same information, and no evidence of the customer being trapped in an AI-only loop.",

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support requests updated/targeted diagnostics after continued freezes, which is not clearly redundant with earlier attachments.

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No gap of 3+ calendar days is clearly shown between a customer message and a support response requiring action. Responses occur within the same day or within ~1\u20132 days in the visible timeline, and the customer does not complain about waiting or cite a prolonged delay.",
