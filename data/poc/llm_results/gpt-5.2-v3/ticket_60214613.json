    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No clear, customer-facing AI (ATLAS/Hermes) response is shown providing incorrect product info, making unfulfilled promises, or being called wrong/unhelpful by the customer. The visible ATLAS content is mainly a routing/intake transcript (priority + request for details), after which humans handled the case.",

  },
  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "No evidence the customer was trapped in an AI loop: no explicit request for a human, no repeated requests for the same info by AI, and the ticket quickly transitions to human handling.",
    "evidence": []
  },
  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support acknowledged new information when the customer corrected the Salesforce opportunity link and continued investigation. There is no clear instance of support asking for the same item after the customer stated it was already provided/tried, nor ignoring the referenced related ticket.",

      "Customer: \"This is the correct Salesforce opportunity: https://trilogy-sales.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Opportunity/006Ih000004fwJXIAY/view\"",
