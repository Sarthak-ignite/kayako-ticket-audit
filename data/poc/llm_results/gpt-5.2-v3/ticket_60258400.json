    "detected": false,

    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer indicates the advice is repetitive, but the strict looping criteria are not met: there are not 3+ consecutive AI responses without a human after an explicit request for a human, and AI does not ask for the same specific information 2+ times. A human responds on 2025-12-09.",

    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "Support repeats already-tried guidance and asks for logs that were already provided in the same ticket.
