  "AI_WALL_LOOPING": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "The customer is not shown being trapped with repeated AI-only interactions. After the initial ATLAS response, humans (Keyur/Marcio/Andriy/Matthew) take over. Also, no clear case of ATLAS asking for the exact same specific info 2+ times after the customer states it was already provided.",

  "IGNORING_CONTEXT": {
    "detected": false,
    "reasoning": "Support corrected misunderstandings (server logs vs. affected agent logs) and continued with targeted requests. While the customer wanted more detailed step-by-step guidance later, support did respond (even if not as detailed as desired), so there is not clear, unambiguous evidence of ignoring already-provided information or repeating the same step after the customer confirmed completion in a way that meets the detection criteria.",

  "RESPONSE_DELAYS": {
    "detected": true,
    "reasoning": "There is a clear 3+ day gap between the customer\u2019s update that the workaround failed and the next substantive support response, and the customer explicitly complained about the lack of response.",

    "reasoning": "Although the customer requested urgency and later emphasized severe business impact, support did escalate to Development (engineering issue created/updated and later a special build provided). The criteria require clear evidence that a P1/SEV1 was mishandled (e.g., no escalation visible, wildly generic/irrelevant steps, or explicit SLA breach), which is not unambiguously present here.",
