It sounds like you're referring to the Let's Encrypt certificate renewal problem where we had you rename a specific file to get things working again.<br><br>Are you experiencing the same issue again with your Let's Encrypt certificate not renewing properly? If so, could you tell me:<br><br>1. <strong>What symptoms are you seeing this time?</strong> (For example, is the certificate expired, getting renewal errors, or something else?)<br>2. <strong>What version of Kerio Connect are you currently running?</strong><br><br>This will help me provide you with the most accurate solution. The fix can vary slightly depending on your Kerio Connect version and the specific nature of the renewal issue.<br/><br><br><b>--- Customer (Rich Voelker) ---</b><br>There are two different domains.  For some reason there are now two certificates for one domain, rather than 1 certificate for each.   Current running 10.0.0.8 patch 1 build 9228<br/><br><br><b>--- AI Assistant ---</b><br>Interesting! So you have two domains, but somehow both Let's Encrypt certificates ended up being issued for the same domain, leaving the other domain without a certificate. That's definitely not what we want.<br><br>Based on the knowledge base, when Kerio Connect has multiple certificates for a single domain, it selects one based on a priority order (trusted certificates with the furthest expiration date get priority). However, this doesn't solve your actual problem - you need one certificate per domain.<br><br>Here's what I'd recommend to fix this:<br><br><strong>Step 1: Check your current certificates</strong><br>1. Go to <strong>Configuration > SSL Certificates</strong> in the Kerio Connect admin interface<br>2. Take a screenshot showing all the certificates listed there - this will help us see exactly what's configured<br><br><strong>Step 2: Delete the duplicate certificate</strong><br>1. Identify which certificate is the duplicate for the same domain<br>2. Delete the extra/duplicate certificate for that domain<br>3. Keep the one with the furthest expiration date if both are valid<br><br><strong>Step 3: Issue a new certificate for the missing domain</strong><br>1. In <strong>Configuration > SSL Certificates</strong>, click on <strong>New > Let's Encrypt Certificate</strong><br>2. Enter the domain name that's currently missing a certificate<br>3. Follow the prompts to issue the certificate<br><br>Before we proceed, could you tell me:<br>- <strong>What are the two domain names</strong> you need certificates for?<br>- <strong>Are both certificates currently showing as valid/active</strong>, or is one expired?<br><br>This will help me guide you more precisely through the cleanup process.<br/><br><br><b>--- Customer (Rich Voelker) ---</b><br>When attempting to request a new certificate the response is \"Server Not Responding\".  Last time something like this happened you had me delete, or possibly rename, a file within the certificates directory(I think), and then maybe had me restart, and then re-request a cert.  Whatever that procedures was worked<br/><br><br><b>--- AI Assistant ---</b><br>Perfect! I found it! Yes, that's exactly the procedure. The \"Server Not Responding\" error is typically caused by an issue with the Let's Encrypt client initialization, and the fix is to delete the <strong>account.key</strong> file.<br><br>Here's the step-by-step process that worked for you before:<br><br><strong>Step 1: Stop Kerio Connect</strong><br>- Stop the Kerio Connect service<br><br><strong>Step 2: Navigate to the Let's Encrypt directory</strong><br>Depending on your operating system:<br>- <strong>Windows</strong>: `C:\\Program Files\\Kerio\\MailServer\\sslcert\\letsencrypt\\`<br>- <strong>Linux</strong>: `/opt/kerio/mailserver/sslcert/letsencrypt/`<br>- <strong>macOS</strong>: `/usr/local/kerio/mailserver/sslcert/letsencrypt/`<br><br><strong>Step 3: Delete the account.key file</strong><br>- In that `letsencrypt` folder, delete the file named <strong>account.key</strong><br><br><strong>Step 4: Start Kerio Connect</strong><br>- Start the Kerio Connect service again<br><br><strong>Step 5: Request the certificate</strong><br>- Go back to <strong>Configuration > SSL Certificates</strong> in the admin interface<br>- Click <strong>New > Let's Encrypt Certificate</strong><br>- Enter the domain name and request the certificate<br><br>This should resolve the \"Server Not Responding\" error and allow you to successfully request a new Let's Encrypt certificate for your second domain.<br><br>What operating system is your Kerio Connect server running on? I want to make sure you're looking in the right directory.<br/><br><br><b>--- Customer (Rich Voelker) ---</b><br>MacOS.  I have done the steps and am waiting for the restart.   Another question:  Why on MacOS does the \"Stop Kerio Connect\" System Setting not stop the server? (Clicking the Stop button seems to have no effect)<br/><br><br><b>--- AI Assistant ---</b><br>Good question! That's actually a known quirk with the Kerio Connect Monitor on macOS. According to the documentation, when using the Kerio Connect Monitor GUI, you need to <strong>click on the lock symbol first and enter your macOS password</strong> before the Stop Server button will actually work.<br><br>Here's the proper sequence:<br><br><strong>Via Kerio Connect Monitor (GUI):</strong><br>1. Launch the Kerio Connect Monitor<br>2. <strong>Click on the lock symbol</strong> \ud83d\udd12<br>3. Enter your macOS password<br>4. <strong>Then</strong> click \"Stop Server\"<br><br>If that still doesn't work reliably, the most dependable method on macOS is to use Terminal commands:<br><br><strong>Via Terminal (more reliable):</strong><br>```bash<br>sudo su - root<br>```<br>(Enter your macOS password)<br><br>```bash<br>/usr/local/kerio/mailserver/KerioMailServer stop<br>```<br><br>To start it back up:<br>```bash<br>/usr/local/kerio/mailserver/KerioMailServer start<br>```<br><br>The Terminal method is generally more reliable and gives you immediate feedback that the service has actually stopped or started.<br><br>Since you've already restarted, once the server comes back up, try requesting that Let's Encrypt certificate again. The account.key deletion should have resolved the \"Server Not Responding\" issue.<br><br>Let me know if the certificate request works now! \ud83e\udd1e<br/>"
