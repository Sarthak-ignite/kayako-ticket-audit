I can definitely help you with requesting a new G2 license.\n\nBased on our knowledge base, here's the process for requesting a new G2 license:\n\nImportant Note: Gensym does not issue licenses for G2 prior to 2021. If you need a license for a previous version, you'll need to contact your account manager directly.\n\nTo get started with your license request, I'll need to gather some information:\n\nCould you tell me which type of license you're looking for?\n\n \t* Site License (issued to a company's name, can be used on any number of machines, always has an expiration date)\n \t* Development License\n \t* Runtime License\n \t* Restricted License\n \t* Embedded License\n \t* Or is this an evaluation license or license extension?\n\nOnce I understand what type of license you need, I'll guide you through the next steps, which will involve filling out a Gensym Authorization Request form and working with our support team to get approval from the Sales Team. \n\n--- Customer (Kyoko Yamada) ---\n\n Raise a ticket \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I understand you'd like to raise a ticket for your new G2 license request. I can help connect you with our support team who will handle this for you.\n\nBefore I transfer you to a live agent who can create the ticket, let me make sure I have the key information they'll need to process your request efficiently:\n\nTo help expedite your license request, could you provide the following details?\n\n \t* License Type - What type of license do you need? (Site License, Development, Runtime, Restricted, or Embedded)\n\n \t* G2 Version - Which version of G2 (2021 or later) do you need the license for?\n\n \t* Authorization Form - Have you already downloaded and filled out the Gensym Authorization Request form [https://gensym-ignitetech.kayako.com/article/53090]? If so, you can upload it using the secure file upload portal I mentioned earlier. \n\n \t* Organization Details - Your organization name and email address\n\n \t* Additional Requirements - Do you also need access to the Release Portal to download the G2 software?\n\nOnce you provide these details, I'll connect you with a live agent who can create the ticket and work with the Sales Team to get your license generated and shared with you.\n\nWhat information can you share with me right now? \n\n--- Customer (Kyoko Yamada) ---\n\n Raise a ticket \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I understand you'd like to proceed with raising a ticket. Let me connect you with our support team right away.
