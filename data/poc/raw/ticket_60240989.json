Thanks for confirming the license. Now let me help you with the upgrade path from version 9.2 to 9.5.<br><br>Based on the knowledge base, here's the good news: <strong>upgrading from Kerio Control 9.2 to 9.5 is straightforward</strong> since you're already on version 9.1 or newer. <br><br>## Upgrade Path<br><br>For versions <strong>9.1 and newer</strong> (which includes your 9.2), you can upgrade directly to the latest version while retaining all your settings. There's no need for intermediate steps.<br><br>Here's what you need to do:<br><br>1. <strong>Download the latest version</strong> from the <a href=\"https://www.gfi.com/products-and-solutions/network-security-solutions/kerio-control/download\" target=\"_blank\">Kerio Control Download Page</a><br><br>2. <strong>Choose the appropriate installation image</strong> based on your appliance type:<br>   - Hardware appliance: Use the upgrade image (.img file)<br>   - VMware: Download the VMware Virtual Appliance<br>   - Hyper-V: Download the Hyper-V Virtual Appliance<br>   - Software Appliance: Use the ISO installer<br><br>3. <strong>Follow the upgrade instructions</strong> detailed in the <a href=\"https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/116456\" target=\"_blank\">How to upgrade to 9.2.8</a> article (the process is the same for upgrading to 9.5)<br><br><strong>Important note:</strong> Since you mentioned 9.5 specifically, just to clarify - are you looking to upgrade to version 9.5.x, or are you interested in the latest available version? The current latest stable release might be newer than 9.5.<br><br>Could you also let me know what type of installation you have (hardware box, VMware, Hyper-V, or software appliance)? This will help me provide more specific guidance.<br/><br><br><b>--- Customer (Guenter Weidlich) ---</b><br>i found a document that described a step by step version upgrade to v10<br/><br><br><b>--- AI Assistant ---</b><br>Ah, excellent! So you're looking to upgrade to <strong>Kerio Control v10</strong> - that's a significant upgrade and there are some important things you should know.<br><br>Yes, we do have documentation for v10! Here's what you need to know:<br><br>## Kerio Control v10 Information<br><br>\ud83d\udcd8 <strong>Customer Guide:</strong> <a href=\"https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/128493\" target=\"_blank\">Kerio Control v10 and New NG Hardware \u2014 Customer Guide</a><br><br>\ud83d\udce5 <strong>Download Location:</strong> The v10 downloads are currently hosted on a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1L0acyUWsgp02QzdUXVKeMl_67tP5mI7Y\" target=\"_blank\">Google Drive shared link</a><br><br>## Important Notes Before Upgrading:<br><br><strong>File Types:</strong><br>- <strong>.img file</strong> - Can be used for upgrading both hardware boxes and software appliances (<a href=\"https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/116539\" target=\"_blank\">upgrade instructions</a>)<br>- <strong>.iso file</strong> - Required for deploying NEW software appliances (\u26a0\ufe0f using .iso to deploy a hardware box will break the box)<br><br><strong>\u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL WARNING:</strong><br><strong>Downgrading from v10 to v9.x is likely to NOT work as expected.</strong> Version 10 has breaking changes and is not backwards compatible with v9.x. Once you upgrade to v10, you should plan to stay on v10.<br><br>Before proceeding, could you tell me:<br>1. What type of installation do you have (hardware box model, VMware, Hyper-V, or software appliance)?<br>2. Have you reviewed the v10 customer guide to understand the changes and new features?<br>3. Do you have a current backup of your configuration?<br><br>This will help ensure a smooth upgrade process! \ud83d\ude80<br/><br><br><b>--- Customer (Guenter Weidlich) ---</b><br>this upgrade is for hardware box.<br>Why is there a difference to upgrade to 9.5 or v10?<br><br/><br><br><b>--- AI Assistant ---</b><br>Great question! Let me explain the key differences between upgrading to 9.5 versus v10 for your hardware box.<br><br>## The Main Differences:<br><br>### <strong>Upgrading to 9.5:</strong><br>- <strong>Straightforward upgrade</strong> - Direct upgrade path from 9.2 to 9.5<br>- <strong>Fully compatible</strong> with existing NG hardware (NG100, NG110, NG300, NG310, NG500, NG510, NG511, NG100W, NG300W)<br>- <strong>Can downgrade</strong> back to 9.x versions if needed<br>- <strong>Standard upgrade process</strong> - Download .img file and apply<br>- New features include: Improved IPS engine (20-40% better performance), OpenVPN support<br><br>### <strong>Upgrading to v10:</strong><br>- <strong>Major version jump</strong> with breaking changes<br>- <strong>Required for NEW hardware</strong> (NG520, NG521, NG700) due to updated network interface drivers<br>- <strong>\u26a0\ufe0f Cannot downgrade</strong> back to 9.x - this is a one-way upgrade<br>- <strong>Not backwards compatible</strong> - v10 has architectural changes that prevent rolling back<br>- Currently in early release phase (downloads via Google Drive)<br><br>## Which Hardware Box Do You Have?<br><br>This is important because:<br><br><strong>If you have:</strong> NG100, NG110, NG300, NG310, NG500, NG510, NG511, NG100W, or NG300W<br>- \u2705 You can upgrade to <strong>either 9.5 or v10</strong><br>- \ud83d\udca1 <strong>Recommendation:</strong> Upgrade to 9.5 first unless you specifically need v10 features<br>- 9.5 is the safer, more stable choice with a rollback option<br><br><strong>If you have:</strong> NG520, NG521, or NG700 (newer models)<br>- \u26a0\ufe0f You <strong>must use v10</strong> - these won't work properly with 9.x<br><br>Could you tell me which specific hardware model you have? This will help me give you the best recommendation for your situation.<br/><br><br><b>--- Customer (Guenter Weidlich) ---</b><br>the hardware is a brain box xl pro or ng500<br/><br><br><b>--- AI Assistant ---</b><br>Perfect! Thanks for clarifying - the <strong>Brain Box XL Pro / NG500</strong> is one of the established NG series hardware boxes. This gives you flexibility in your upgrade choice.<br><br>## For Your NG500 Hardware:<br><br>\u2705 <strong>You can upgrade to EITHER 9.5 or v10</strong> - both are compatible with your NG500 hardware.<br><br>## My Recommendation:<br><br>Given your situation, here's what I'd suggest:<br><br>### <strong>Option 1: Upgrade to 9.5 (Recommended for most users)</strong><br><strong>Pros:</strong><br>- \u2705 Stable, production-ready release<br>- \u2705 Can rollback to 9.2 if issues arise<br>- \u2705 Standard upgrade process<br>- \u2705 Includes great new features (improved IPS performance, OpenVPN support)<br>- \u2705 Well-documented and tested<br><br><strong>Best for:</strong> Production environments where stability is critical<br><br>### <strong>Option 2: Upgrade to v10</strong><br><strong>Pros:</strong><br>- \u2705 Latest version with newest features<br>- \u2705 Future-proof (will be the standard going forward)<br><br><strong>Cons:</strong><br>- \u26a0\ufe0f <strong>Cannot rollback</strong> to 9.x once upgraded<br>- \u26a0\ufe0f Breaking changes - not backwards compatible<br>- \u26a0\ufe0f Currently in early release phase<br>- \u26a0\ufe0f Downloads via Google Drive (not standard download portal yet)<br><br><strong>Best for:</strong> Testing environments or if you specifically need v10 features and accept the no-rollback limitation<br><br>## What's Your Use Case?<br><br>To help you make the best decision:<br>- Is this a production firewall or a test environment?<br>- Do you have a specific reason for wanting v10, or were you just following the documentation you found?<br>- Do you have a recent backup of your configuration?<br><br>Most customers in production environments choose 9.5 for now, then plan a v10 upgrade later when it's fully production-ready. What are your thoughts?<br/>"
