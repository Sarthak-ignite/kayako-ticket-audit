Here are the key findings.\n\nYour Nov 27 deployment logs show all 3 patches (KB890830, Firefox 143.0.4, KB5066131) were successfully deployed to CGQUILIT:\n\n\t* Patches 1 & 2: Completed with Exit Status 0\n\t* Patch 3: Deployed successfully, but status message not received by LanGuard\n\nYour video confirms these updates are installed in Windows Update.\nimage\nThe Windows malicious software removal tool update would be found under \u00a0Settings > Windows Update > Update History > Other update or Quality Update.\u00a0\n\nThe PatchAgent service completes the installations on the target machine, but the communication connection to LanGuard server likely closes prematurely before final status messages are sent back. This isn't a port blocking issue (since initial communication works fine) - it's the connection dropping during active deployment. As a result, patches install successfully, but LanGuard marks them \"incomplete\" because it never receives confirmation.\n\nThe uploaded PatchAgent.log stops at Nov 19, but your remediation was on Nov 27. So we are unable to see what happened during the connection closure.\n\nSince we the updates did complete, please run a Full Scan on CGQUILIT as required as a remediation job;\u00a0the console may be displaying outdated information. After the rescan:\n\n\t* These 3 patches should disappear from Remediation Center\n\t* We'll see the true current state\n\nIf you are still experiencing the issue, please provide\u00a0\n\n\t* Saving and loading scan results in xml [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122526]\n\n\t* Backup and delete the PatchAgent.log file from the target machine (CGQUILIT) and proceed to perform the remediation again\n\n\t* Attach the C:\\Windows\\Patches\\PatchAgent.log file located in the target machine.\n\n\t* The\u00a0troubleshooter logs from GFI LanGuard server [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122371]\n\nBest regards,\nIbiso Barimalaa\nGFI - LanGuard Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.

We also checked the update history and validated that no updates have been applied, even though support previously mentioned that one would be released. According to their statement: \u201cIf you are seeing the timeout even after setting the maximum timeout in the remediation options (6000s), but the patch is still deploying successfully, we are currently unable to increase the timeout further in the product. The deployment will complete as expected; however, the LanGuard console will not report it because the PatchAgent process stops communicating with the server once the timeout is reached.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, as shown in the screenshot below, some remediation files complete successfully, but when it comes to the .NET Framework despite being a small package the remediation fails."

Let's tackle this deployment timeout issue together. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI found some really helpful information about this exact problem. The Timed out: The Patch Agent did not respond in the permitted time interval error is actually pretty common when deploying large packages or service packs with GFI LanGuard.\n\nHere's the good news: the patch may actually still be installing successfully on the target machine even though you're seeing the timeout error. The timeout just means the installation didn't complete within the configured time limit, but the patch agent continues working in the background.\n\nLet me walk you through the main solutions:\n\n1. INCREASE THE DEPLOYMENT TIMEOUT\n\nThe default timeout is 10 minutes, which can be too short for large packages. Here's how to increase it:\n\n \t* Go to the GFI LanGuard Console and select Remediate\n \t* Choose the computers/groups to patch and select the patch(es) you want to deploy\n \t* Click the Remediate... button\n \t* Select the Advanced Options hyperlink (or click the third Customize hyperlink, then click Advanced)\n \t* Increment the value for Deployment Timeout (maximum is 6000 seconds)\n \t* Check Remember settings to make this change permanent\n \t* Click OK to run the job\n\n2. VERIFY HTTP COMMUNICATIONS AREN&#39;T BLOCKED\n\nMake sure the agent can access the LanGuard server's communication port (default is 1072):\n\n \t* From the agent machine, open: http://<LanguardServerIP>:1072/files/update/index.txt\n \t* Or test with telnet: telnet <LanGuard_IP> 1072\n\nIf the port isn't responding, you'll need to configure your firewall to allow TCP/IP traffic on port 1072.\n\nCould you tell me what timeout value you currently have configured, and approximately how large is the package you're trying to deploy? This will help me guide you to the right timeout setting.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Source: Resolving Patch Deployment Timeout Error [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122760] \n\n--- Customer (Jonard Umerez) ---\n\n create a ticket for this \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Absolutely, I can help you get connected with our support team to create a ticket for this deployment timeout issue.\n\nBefore I transfer you to a live agent who will create the ticket, let me just confirm a few quick details to make sure they have everything they need:\n\n \t* What size is the package you're trying to deploy (approximate MB/GB)?\n \t* What is your current deployment timeout setting (if you know it)?\n \t* Have you tried increasing the timeout value yet, or would you like the support team to guide you through that?\n\nThis information will help our support team assist you more efficiently once they create your ticket! \ud83c\udfab \n\n--- Customer (Jonard Umerez) ---\n\n create a ticket \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for letting me know you'd like to create a ticket! \ud83d\ude0a A human colleague will be happy to assist you further\u2014please feel free to choose from the available options to connect with them. \ud83d\udcde\u2728 \n\n--- Customer (Jonard Umerez) ---\n\n Button selection: [\ud83d\udce9 Raise a ticket] \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Please provide any other additional details we might need to investigate and resolve your issue.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 If the reported behavior affects multiple end-customers, please do let us know the impact radius of the issue.\n\nYou can use Shift+Enter if you want to continue typing in a new line.\n\nFor now, I am unable to take any file uploads, so any relevant log files or attachments can be provided directly in the ticket once I create it for you.\n\n \ud83d\udcccImportant: Your ticket will be created in one of two ways:\n\n\t* Immediately after you provide the requested information above, or\n\n\t* Automatically after 5 minutes if no response is received\n\nPlease keep this browser/chat window open until you receive your ticket number as confirmation. \n\n--- Customer (Jonard Umerez) ---\n\n . \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n If you want to add additional \ud83d\udce7 email addresses in the ticket CC, please specify them below.\n\nYou can specify multiple email addresses, separated by a comma (for example: test@example.com, test2@example.com)\n\nOtherwise, just click the button \ud83d\udc47 \n"
