          "Kayako - ticket id 60098171 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Ralph,\n\nThank you for your continued updates and for clarifying the persistent Failed (VSE) errors immediately after reinstalling GFI MailEssentials. I understand your frustration, especially since your configuration has not changed for years and you have already attempted both standard and non-clean reinstalls.\n\nThe Failed (VSE) error specifically indicates a malfunction in the Virus Scanning Engine (VSE) component of MailEssentials. This is a critical part of the email scanning process, and when it fails, all inbound emails are blocked from delivery. Based on your description and the troubleshooting already performed, here are the most targeted steps and considerations to address this:\n\n1. Addressing the \"Failed (VSE)\" Error\nThe VSE error is most commonly caused by:\n\n \t* Corrupted or outdated virus definition files\n \t* Conflicts with other antivirus software on the server\n \t* Insufficient permissions for the MailEssentials service account\n \t* Residual files from previous installations causing conflicts\n\n2. Clean Reinstallation Procedure (Preserving Configuration and Data)\nTo resolve persistent VSE errors, a clean reinstallation is recommended. This process removes all residual files that may be causing the issue, while allowing you to restore your configuration and historical data:\n\n\t* Backup Configuration and Data: \n\n \t* Backup the following folders (default paths shown, adjust if your installation uses custom paths):\n\n \t* Configuration: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GFI\\MailEssentials\\ (or C:\\Program Files\\GFI\\MailEssentials\\) \u2013 especially the Config, Antispam, Antivirus, and Quarantine subfolders.\n \t* Data: C:\\ProgramData\\GFI\\MailEssentials\\ (or C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\GFI\\MailEssentials\\ on older systems).\n \t* Custom Rules/Filters: Usually within the Config or Antispam subfolders.\n \t* Quarantine and Historical Data: Backup the Quarantine folder and any related database files.\n\n \t* If your version supports it, use the built-in export tool to save your configuration settings.\n\n\t* Uninstall MailEssentials: \n\n \t* Use the standard Windows uninstall process to remove MailEssentials.\n \t* After uninstalling, manually delete any remaining MailEssentials folders from the installation and data directories to ensure no corrupted files remain.\n \t* Reboot the server before proceeding.\n\n\t* Reinstall the Latest Version: \n\n \t* Download and install the latest version of GFI MailEssentials from the official site.\n\n\t* Restore Configuration and Data: \n\n \t* With MailEssentials services stopped, copy your backed-up configuration and data folders back to their original locations.\n \t* Ensure the service account running MailEssentials has full permissions on all restored folders and files.\n \t* Restart MailEssentials services and verify that the configuration and historical data are intact.\n\n3. Additional Recommendations\n\n \t* Ensure no other antivirus software is scanning MailEssentials directories or interfering with its processes. If present, configure exclusions for all MailEssentials folders.\n \t* After reinstalling, check for updates to virus definitions and the scanning engine within MailEssentials.\n \t* Monitor the logs for any recurring VSE errors or permission issues.\n\n4.

I understand the importance of not losing years of configuration and email history.\n\nTo retain your configuration and historical data, you will need to back up specific files and folders before uninstalling MailEssentials. Below are the key components you should preserve:\n\n1. Configuration Files and Folders\nMailEssentials stores its configuration in several locations, depending on your version and installation path. Typically, you should back up the following:\n\n \t* MailEssentials Configuration Folder: By default, this is located at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GFI\\MailEssentials\\ or C:\\Program Files\\GFI\\MailEssentials\\. Within this folder, pay special attention to subfolders such as Config, Antispam, Antivirus, and Quarantine.\n \t* MailEssentials Data Folder: This may include logs, quarantine data, and other operational files. The default path is often C:\\ProgramData\\GFI\\MailEssentials\\ or C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\GFI\\MailEssentials\\ on older systems.\n \t* Custom Rules and Filters: If you have created custom rules, filters, or whitelist/blacklist entries, ensure these files are included in your backup. They are usually found within the Config or Antispam subfolders.\n\n2. Quarantine and Historical Data\nIf you wish to retain the quarantine and historical email data, back up the Quarantine folder and any related database files. These are typically found within the main MailEssentials installation directory or the data folder mentioned above.\n\n3. Exporting Settings (Optional)\nSome versions of MailEssentials provide a built-in export/import tool for configuration settings. If available, use this feature to create a backup of your settings before uninstalling. This can simplify the restoration process after reinstallation.\n\n4. Restoring After Reinstallation\nAfter performing a clean installation of MailEssentials, you can restore your configuration and data by copying the backed-up folders and files back to their original locations. Ensure that MailEssentials services are stopped before restoring files, and restart the services once restoration is complete.\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n \t* Always ensure you have a full backup of your system and MailEssentials data before making any changes.\n \t* If you are unsure about the exact file paths or need to confirm the location of specific configuration files, you can check the MailEssentials documentation or review the application settings for custom paths.\n \t* After restoring, verify that permissions on the restored folders and files are correct, and that the MailEssentials service account has full access.\n\nFor further reference, you may find these articles helpful:\n\n \t* Emails Are Not Processing After Changing the Path of the Pickup or Replay Folders [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181259-Emails-Are-Not-Processing-After-Changing-the-Path-of-the-Pickup-or-Replay-Folders]\n \t* Emails are not processed in the dashboard and a large number of temp files in the Windows Temp directory [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181219-Emails-are-not-processed-in-the-dashboard-and-a-large-number-of-temp-files-in-the-Windows-Temp-directory]\n \t* MailEssentials is not processing emails and emails go to FailedMails folder [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181299-MailEssentials-is-not-processing-emails-and-emails-go-to-FailedMails-folder]\n \t* A large number of emails are building up in the BadMail folder and queues [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/117334]\n\nIf you need clarification on any of the steps above or have questions about specific files or folders, please let me know and I will be happy to provide further guidance.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - MailEssentials Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60098171 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Ralph,\n\nThank you for your detailed updates and for clarifying that the configuration has remained unchanged for years, with the only recent observation being persistent Failed (VSE) errors for all scanned inbound emails, which in turn halted all email flow through GFI MailEssentials. I understand that uninstalling and reinstalling MailEssentials, as well as creating a new SMTP Virtual Server, did not resolve the issue, and that normal mail flow resumes only when MailEssentials is disabled.\n\nBased on your description and the consistent Failed (VSE) errors, this points to a problem within the MailEssentials scanning engine or its integration with the SMTP service. Here are comprehensive steps and considerations to help you address this:\n\n1. Investigate the \"Failed (VSE)\" Errors\nThe \"VSE\" typically refers to the Virus Scanning Engine. If all emails are failing at this stage, it may indicate a corruption or malfunction in the antivirus scanning component of MailEssentials. This can occur due to:\n\n \t* Corrupted virus definition files or engine updates\n \t* Conflicts with other antivirus software running on the server\n \t* Insufficient permissions for the MailEssentials service account to access scanning components\n \t* Outdated or incompatible MailEssentials installation with your current server environment\n\nRecommended Actions:\n\n \t* Clear Temporary and Definition Files: Stop the MailEssentials services and manually clear out the temporary files and virus definition folders. Upon restarting, MailEssentials will attempt to download fresh definitions.\n \t* Check for Conflicting Antivirus Software: Ensure that no other antivirus software is scanning the same mail directories or interfering with MailEssentials processes. If present, configure exclusions for MailEssentials folders and processes.\n \t* Update MailEssentials: Make sure you are running the latest version of MailEssentials, as updates often resolve compatibility and scanning engine issues.\n \t* Review Permissions: Confirm that the service account running MailEssentials has full control over all related folders (Pickup, Replay, Queue, Temp, and definition folders).\n\nFor further reference, please review these relevant articles:\n\n \t* Emails Are Not Processing After Changing the Path of the Pickup or Replay Folders [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181259-Emails-Are-Not-Processing-After-Changing-the-Path-of-the-Pickup-or-Replay-Folders]\n \t* Emails are not processed in the dashboard and a large number of temp files in the Windows Temp directory [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181219-Emails-are-not-processed-in-the-dashboard-and-a-large-number-of-temp-files-in-the-Windows-Temp-directory]\n \t* MailEssentials is not processing emails and emails go to FailedMails folder [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181299-MailEssentials-is-not-processing-emails-and-emails-go-to-FailedMails-folder]\n \t* A large number of emails are building up in the BadMail folder and queues [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/117334]\n\n2. Analyze Event and Application Logs\nSince you have observed SMTP protocol and GFI sink errors, continue to review the Windows Event Viewer and MailEssentials logs for any specific error codes or messages related to the VSE failures. These logs can provide direct clues about the root cause, such as permission issues, file corruption, or engine initialization failures.\n\n3. Consider a Clean Reinstallation\nIf the above steps do not resolve the issue, a clean reinstallation of MailEssentials may be necessary. This involves:\n\n \t* Uninstalling MailEssentials\n \t* Manually deleting any remaining MailEssentials folders (after backing up configuration if needed)\n \t* Rebooting the server\n \t* Reinstalling the latest version of MailEssentials\n\nThis process ensures that any corrupted files or settings are fully cleared before a fresh installation.\n\nIf you continue to experience Failed (VSE) errors after these steps, focus on the specific error messages in your logs, as they will be key to identifying the underlying cause. If you need clarification on any of the steps above or encounter specific error codes, please let us know the details so we can provide more targeted guidance.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - MailEssentials Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

I understand that you have attempted both uninstalling and reinstalling MailEssentials, as well as creating a new SMTP Virtual Server, but the problem persists with emails becoming stuck in the SMTP queue.\n\nBased on your observations and the information available in our knowledge base, here are comprehensive steps and considerations to help address this persistent mail flow issue:\n\n1. Review Pickup, Replay, and Queue Folder Configuration\nMailEssentials relies on the correct configuration and accessibility of the Pickup, Replay, and SMTP queue folders to process and deliver emails. Please ensure that:\n\n \t* The folder paths configured in MailEssentials exactly match those set in your Exchange or SMTP server.\n \t* The folders are accessible and have not been moved, renamed, or had permissions changed.\n \t* No antivirus or backup software is locking or interfering with these folders.\n\nFor more details, see: Emails Are Not Processing After Changing the Path of the Pickup or Replay Folders [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181259-Emails-Are-Not-Processing-After-Changing-the-Path-of-the-Pickup-or-Replay-Folders].\n\n2. Inspect BadMail, FailedMails, and Temp Directories\nA buildup of emails in the BadMail or FailedMails folders, or a large number of temporary files in the Windows Temp directory, can indicate a processing or delivery issue. Please check these locations for undelivered messages:\n\n \t* MailEssentials is not processing emails and emails go to FailedMails folder [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181299-MailEssentials-is-not-processing-emails-and-emails-go-to-FailedMails-folder]\n \t* Emails are not processed in the dashboard and a large number of temp files in the Windows Temp directory [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181219-Emails-are-not-processed-in-the-dashboard-and-a-large-number-of-temp-files-in-the-Windows-Temp-directory]\n \t* A large number of emails are building up in the BadMail folder and queues [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/117334]\n\n3. Confirm Service Account Permissions\nThe Windows account running the MailEssentials services must have full read/write permissions to the Pickup, Replay, SMTP queue, BadMail, and FailedMails folders. Insufficient permissions can prevent emails from being moved out of the queue and delivered to Exchange or the intended destination.\n\n4. Analyze Event Logs and MailEssentials Logs\nSince you have observed numerous SMTP protocol and GFI sink errors in the logs, it is important to:\n\n \t* Review the specific error messages in the Windows Event Viewer and MailEssentials logs for clues about the underlying cause (e.g., protocol errors, access denied, file locking).\n \t* Look for patterns or repeated error codes that may indicate a configuration or compatibility issue.\n\n5. Check for Filtering or Quarantine Issues\nIf you are using filtering modules such as SpamRazer, ensure that legitimate emails are not being incorrectly blocked or quarantined. You can review and reprocess such emails as described in: MailEssentials is not processing emails and emails go to FailedMails folder [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181299-MailEssentials-is-not-processing-emails-and-emails-go-to-FailedMails-folder].\n\n6. Consider SMTP Virtual Server Binding and Compatibility\nWhen creating a new SMTP Virtual Server and binding GFI to it, ensure that:\n\n \t* The new server is properly configured and recognized by both MailEssentials and Exchange.\n \t* All necessary ports are open and not blocked by firewall or security software.\n \t* There are no conflicts with other services or applications using the same SMTP resources.\n\nIf after reviewing these areas the issue persists, focus on the specific SMTP protocol and GFI sink errors in your logs, as these will provide the most direct clues to the root cause. Addressing any permission, configuration, or compatibility issues highlighted in the logs is key to restoring normal mail flow.\n\nIf you need further clarification on any of the steps above or encounter specific error messages that you would like to discuss, please let us know the details so we can provide more targeted guidance.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - MailEssentials Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

Based on your latest observation that emails appear to be stuck in the SMTP queue when GFI MailEssentials scanning is enabled, while disabling scanning allows immediate delivery, this strongly suggests an issue with the mail handoff process between MailEssentials and your Exchange server.\n\nHere are targeted steps and references to help you resolve this scenario:\n\n1. Review Pickup and Replay Folder Configuration\nMailEssentials relies on the correct configuration of the Pickup and Replay folders to transfer processed emails to Exchange. If these paths are incorrect or inaccessible, emails may remain stuck in the SMTP queue.

Based on your description, it appears that MailEssentials is scanning emails, but they are not reaching the Exchange server unless email processing is disabled.\n\nThis scenario can occur due to several reasons. Below are some targeted troubleshooting steps and references to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. Check Pickup and Replay Folder Paths\nIf the path for the Pickup or Replay folders has been changed or is incorrect, MailEssentials may process emails but fail to deliver them to Exchange. Please verify that the Pickup and Replay folder paths in MailEssentials match the configuration of your Exchange server. For more details, refer to the article: Emails Are Not Processing After Changing the Path of the Pickup or Replay Folders [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181259-Emails-Are-Not-Processing-After-Changing-the-Path-of-the-Pickup-or-Replay-Folders].\n\n2. Inspect for FailedMails or Temp Files\nSometimes, emails that cannot be processed are moved to the FailedMails folder or accumulate as temporary files in the Windows Temp directory. Please check these locations for any undelivered emails. If you find a large number of temp files, it may indicate a processing issue. For more information, see: Emails are not processed in the dashboard and a large number of temp files in the Windows Temp directory [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181219-Emails-are-not-processed-in-the-dashboard-and-a-large-number-of-temp-files-in-the-Windows-Temp-directory] and MailEssentials is not processing emails and emails go to FailedMails folder [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181299-MailEssentials-is-not-processing-emails-and-emails-go-to-FailedMails-folder].\n\n3. Confirm No Recent Configuration Changes\nYou mentioned that there have been no changes to the Exchange server. Please also ensure that no recent updates or configuration changes have been made to MailEssentials or the underlying server environment that could affect mail flow.\n\n4. Review Event Logs\nCheck the Windows Event Viewer and MailEssentials logs for any error messages or warnings that could provide more insight into why emails are not being delivered to Exchange.\n\n5. Test with Email Processing Disabled\nYou noted that when email processing is disabled, emails are delivered correctly. This suggests the issue is isolated to the MailEssentials processing pipeline. Double-check all MailEssentials transport settings and ensure that the service account running MailEssentials has the necessary permissions to access the Exchange Pickup/Replay folders.\n\nIf after following these steps the issue persists, please let us know any specific error messages or log entries you observe, as this will help further narrow down the cause.\n\nFor your convenience, here are the most relevant articles again:\n\n \t* Emails Are Not Processing After Changing the Path of the Pickup or Replay Folders [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181259-Emails-Are-Not-Processing-After-Changing-the-Path-of-the-Pickup-or-Replay-Folders]\n \t* Emails are not processed in the dashboard and a large number of temp files in the Windows Temp directory [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181219-Emails-are-not-processed-in-the-dashboard-and-a-large-number-of-temp-files-in-the-Windows-Temp-directory]\n \t* MailEssentials is not processing emails and emails go to FailedMails folder [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015181299-MailEssentials-is-not-processing-emails-and-emails-go-to-FailedMails-folder]\n\nIf you need further clarification on any of the steps above, please let us know.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - MailEssentials Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

For example:\n- Are you seeing any error messages?\n- Is a specific feature not working?\n- When did the issue start?\n- Have there been any recent changes or updates?\n\nThe more details you can provide, the better I can help you troubleshoot! \nRalph Venturino:\n\n Email not sent to exchange server \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for letting me know. I understand how concerning it can be when emails aren\u2019t reaching your Exchange server. I\u2019m here to help get this sorted out for you.\n\nTo get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the issue?\n- Are all emails failing to be delivered, or just some?\n- Are you seeing any error messages in GFI MailEssentials or Exchange?\n- When did this problem start?\n- Have there been any recent changes to your server, network, or MailEssentials configuration?\n\nOnce I have a bit more detail, I\u2019ll guide you through some targeted troubleshooting steps. \nRalph Venturino:\n\n All emails. \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for clarifying that all emails are affected. That definitely sounds urgent.\n\nLet me ask a few more questions to narrow this down:\n1. Are you seeing any error messages or alerts in the GFI MailEssentials dashboard or logs?\n2. Is the Exchange server running and accessible from the MailEssentials server (for example, can you ping it or connect via Remote Desktop)?\n3. Did this start after a recent update, configuration change, or server restart?\n4. Are emails stuck in a queue, or do they disappear entirely?\n\nYour answers will help me pinpoint where the issue might be. If you\u2019re not sure about any of these, just let me know what you do see or experience. \nRalph Venturino:\n\n Dashboard is functioning and processing emails correctly. They are not reaching exchange server. When email processing is diabled and not being scanned, email work correctly \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for the detailed info\u2014that\u2019s really helpful! So, just to confirm:\n- When GFI MailEssentials is enabled and processing emails, they don\u2019t reach your Exchange server.\n- When you disable email processing (so MailEssentials isn\u2019t scanning), emails are delivered to Exchange as expected.\n\nThat suggests the issue is likely related to how MailEssentials is handling or relaying the emails to Exchange.\n\nLet\u2019s try a few targeted troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. Check the MailEssentials SMTP Relay Settings:\n- Make sure MailEssentials is configured to relay emails to the correct Exchange server IP address and port.\n- Double-check for any typos or recent changes in these settings.\n\n2. Review the MailEssentials Logs:\n- Look for any errors or warnings in the logs, especially around the time emails are processed but not delivered.\n- Common log locations:\n- C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentialsEmailSecurityDebugLogs\n- C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentialsAntiSpamDebugLogs\n\n3. Check for Quarantined or Stuck Emails:\n- Are emails being quarantined, or do they appear stuck in any MailEssentials queue?\n- You can check the Quarantine and Pickup folders, typically found in the MailEssentials installation directory.\n\n4. Firewall/Antivirus Interference:\n- Sometimes, security software can block MailEssentials from relaying emails to Exchange.\n- Has there been any recent change to firewall or antivirus settings?\n\n5. Exchange Server Connectivity:\n- From the MailEssentials server, try to telnet to the Exchange server on the SMTP port (usually 25).\n- Open Command Prompt and run:\n``\ntelnet [ExchangeServerIP] 25\n `\n- Do you get a response?\n\nCould you let me know:\n- If you see any errors in the logs?\n- If emails are stuck in a queue or folder?\n- If the relay settings look correct?\n\nOnce you check these, I\u2019ll guide you through the next steps based on what you find. If you need help with any of these steps, just let me know! \nRalph Venturino:\n\n I don't seem to find any queue for mail. No changes to exchange server \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for checking! So, to recap:\n- No visible mail queue in GFI MailEssentials.\n- No recent changes to the Exchange server.\n- When MailEssentials scanning is disabled, mail flows normally.\n- When scanning is enabled, mail is processed but not delivered to Exchange, and there are no obvious errors or quarantined messages.\n\nLet\u2019s dig a bit deeper. Here are a few more things to check:\n\n1. MailEssentials Pickup/Failed Folders:\nSometimes, undelivered emails end up in the Pickup, Failed, or Badmail folders. Could you check these locations on your MailEssentials server?\n- Default paths:\n- C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentialsPickup\n- C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentialsFailed\n- C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentialsBadmail\nAre there any files piling up in these folders?\n\n2. MailEssentials Debug Logs:\nEven if there\u2019s no queue, the debug logs might show why emails aren\u2019t being relayed. Could you check for any recent error or warning entries in:\n- C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentialsEmailSecurityDebugLogs\n- C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentialsAntiSpamDebugLogs\nIf you spot any recurring error messages, please share the details (or you can upload a log file for analysis).\n\n3. SMTP Relay Test:\nLet\u2019s confirm that MailEssentials can still connect to Exchange\u2019s SMTP service:\n- On the MailEssentials server, open Command Prompt and run:\n `\ntelnet [ExchangeServerIP] 25\n `\n- Do you get a response (like a banner from Microsoft ESMTP)?\n\n4. MailEssentials Routing Settings:\n- In the MailEssentials configuration, double-check the SMTP relay/routing settings to ensure the correct Exchange server and port are specified.\n\n5. MailEssentials Services:\n- Are all GFI MailEssentials services running? Sometimes a stuck or stopped service can cause mail flow issues.\n\nCould you let me know what you find in the Pickup/Failed/Badmail folders and if there are any notable errors in the debug logs? If you\u2019d like, you can also upload a recent log file for me to analyze.\n\nWe\u2019re getting closer to the root cause! \nRalph Venturino:\n\n I don't seem to find those folders \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for checking. Hmm, if you\u2019re not seeing the Pickup, Failed, or Badmail folders in the default locations, it\u2019s possible that:\n- The folders are located elsewhere due to a custom installation path,\n- Or, the mail flow is handled differently in your environment (for example, using SMTP connectors or different routing settings).\n\nLet\u2019s try the following:\n\n1. Confirm Mail Flow Path:\n- Is GFI MailEssentials installed directly on the Exchange server, or is it on a separate gateway/server?\n- Are you using SMTP mode or the Transport Agent mode for MailEssentials?\n\n2. Check MailEssentials Configuration for Folders:\n- In the MailEssentials configuration interface, look for any settings that specify the location of mail pickup or failed mail folders.\n- Sometimes these paths are customized during installation.\n\n3. Search for Recent Files:\n- On the MailEssentials server, you can search for recently modified files or folders named \u201cPickup,\u201d \u201cFailed,\u201d or \u201cBadmail.\u201d\n- Open File Explorer and search for \u201cPickup\u201d or \u201cFailed\u201d in C:Program FilesGFIMailEssentials` and its subfolders.\n\n4. Review the MailEssentials Dashboard:\n- Does the dashboard show any errors, warnings, or unusual activity in the mail flow or system health sections?\n\n5. Check Windows Event Viewer:\n- Sometimes, mail flow issues are logged in the Windows Event Viewer under \u201cApplication\u201d or \u201cSystem\u201d logs. Look for any GFI or SMTP-related errors around the time emails are processed.\n\nCould you let me know:\n- Whether MailEssentials is installed on the same server as Exchange or on a separate server?\n- If you see any errors or warnings in the MailEssentials dashboard or Event Viewer?\n- If you\u2019re able to find any custom folder paths in the configuration?\n\nThis info will help me guide you to the next best troubleshooting step! \nRalph Venturino:\n\n IK checked all I can.
