Let's continue without files \nChat Support:\n\n Thank you for confirming the license key. I understand you'd like to downgrade this license key to version 18.2. I'd be happy to help you with that process.\n\nTo downgrade your FaxMaker license key to version 18.2, we'll need to involve our support team. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. Request a downgrade: I'll need to create a support ticket to request the downgrade of your license key to version 18.2. Our support team will process this request for you.\n\n2. Waiting period: Once the ticket is created, please allow some time for our support team to process your request. They will work on downgrading the license key to the specific version you need (18.2 in this case).\n\n3. Receiving the downgraded key: After processing, you'll receive the downgraded license key from our support team through the ticket.\n\n4. Applying the new key: Once you receive the downgraded license key, you'll need to apply it to your FaxMaker system. This process involves accessing the FaxMaker Configuration and entering the new license key.\n\n5. Verification: After applying the new key, it's important to verify that it works correctly with your FaxMaker version 18.2 system.\n\nTo proceed with this process, I'll need to ask for a support agent to create a ticket for you. This will ensure that your request is properly logged and processed by our team.\n\nIs there any additional information or context you'd like to provide before I ask for a support agent to create this ticket for you?\n\n-------------------------\n\nFor more details check:\n\ud83d\udc49 Downgrading Your FaxMaker License Key [https://support.faxmaker.gfi.com/article/113164]\n\ud83d\udc49 License Key Invalid After Renewal or Upgrade [https://support.faxmaker.gfi.com/article/113184]\n\ud83d\udc49 GFI FaxMaker 20 Release Notes [https://support.faxmaker.gfi.com/article/114607] \nChat Support:\n\n Take all the time you need to read through the provided resources \u261d\ufe0f\nI'll stay here in case you need anything else \ud83d\ude00\n\n-------------------------\n\nWas this helpful? \nAlperia:\n\n \u274c No, it didn't help \nChat Support:\n\n \ud83d\ude1e I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you today! \nAlperia:\n\n \ud83d\udcac Chat with live agent \nChat Support:\n\n Our agents are currently busy assisting other customers at the time, so we'll proceed with ticket creation \nChat Support:\n\n Please provide any other additional details we might need to investigate and resolve your issue.\n\nYou can use Shift+Enter if you want to continue typing in a new line.\n\nFor now, I am unable to take any file uploads, so any relevant log files or attachments can be provided directly in the ticket once I create it for you.\n\n Please note: the ticket will get created only after you provide the above requested information or after a 5-minute timeout. \nAlperia:\n\n Hey, please downgrade this license key to version 18.2 \nChat Support:\n\n I'm creating a ticket for you with the information you've provided, allow me a few moments while I work on this \u23f3 \nChat Support:\n\n I've automatically set the ticket subject to: Downgrade license key to version 18.2\n\nDoes that work for you?\n- If it does, simply say YES or use the below button to confirm \ud83d\udc47\n- If not, please directly type in the ticket subject of your choosing below \ud83d\ude09 "
