While you mentioned that a ping to register.kerio.com was successful\u2014which is indeed unusual\u2014the log indicates that DNS resolution failed at the time of the licensing attempt. This suggests a possible transient DNS issue or inconsistent resolver behavior.\n\nTo address this, we recommend configuring a DNS forwarding rule specifically for Kerio domains. Please follow the steps outlined in the official guide below to forward all DNS queries for *.kerio.com to public resolvers like 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8: Configuring DNS Forwarding in Kerio Control [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/117686-configuring-dns-forwarding-service-in-kerio-control]\n\nIf the issue persists after setting up the forwarding rule, we kindly ask you to re-collect the debug logs, ensuring the following:\n\n\t* Clear the current debug log.\n\t* Enable DNS-related and licensing-related debug messages.\n\t* Reproduce the issue.\n\t* Export and share the new debug log file with us.\n\nAdditionally, please run the following commands directly from the Kerio Control appliance and share their output with us:\n\nnslookup\u00a0register.kerio.com\ndig\u00a0register.kerio.com\n\nThis will help us verify DNS resolution from the appliance\u2019s environment.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation and look forward to resolving this with you as swiftly as possible.\n\nBest regards,\nSyed Haider\nGFI - Kerio Control Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal. We will write to you again to remind you."

          "Kayako - ticket id 60069509 // Syed Haider commented publicly: Dear Alex,\n\nThank you for your continued patience, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused.\n\nWe\u2019d like to confirm that there is no issue with the license key itself. I have successfully applied the same license key on a test instance without any errors.\n\nimage\n\nThis confirms that the problem is occurring at the application level on your appliance, rather than at the license level.\n\nSince we see that you are using a virtual appliance, it would be ideal to try spinning up a new virtual machine for Kerio Control and applying the license key to that instance. This test will help us quickly rule out any application-level issues on the current virtual machine.\n\nUpon reviewing the logs you previously shared, we noticed several malformed TCP packet errors and incomplete 3-way handshakes, which could potentially disrupt the license update process:\n\n[10/Jun/2025\u00a011:52:21]\u00a0DROP\u00a0malformed\u00a0TCP\u00a0packet\u00a0(illegal\u00a0TCP\u00a0ports\u00a0in\u00a0packet\u00a0header),\u00a0\u00a0from\u00a0VLAN\u00a010,\u00a0proto:TCP,\u00a0len:40,\u00a079.124.62.134:0\u00a0-&gt;\u00a0219.89.126.203:5062,\u00a0flags:[\u00a0SYN\u00a0],\u00a0seq:2663298224\u00a0ack:0,\u00a0win:1024,\u00a0tcplen:0\n```[10/Jun/2025 11:47:58] {pktdrop} packet dropped: 3-way handshake not completed (from Port6 LAN 192.168.2.2, proto:TCP, len:171, 192.168.2.55:63075 -> 52.98.143.114:443, flags:[ FIN ACK PSH ], seq:1645862517 ack:2081381515, win:2048, tcplen:119)``\n\nTo address these issues and potentially resolve the license update problem, we recommend the following steps:\n\n\t* Disable 3-way handshake as guided in Effects of disabling 3 way handshaking [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/119722].\n\t* Disable GRO for your interfaces [https://www.loom.com/share/87a73e0af0d046faaabeafbd8b88e30d?sid=35fd909b-c650-4245-b23e-d51037db0217].\n\nIf your appliance still gets stuck when attempting to update the license, we will need additional information to continue our investigation. Please provide the following logs after reproducing the issue:\n\n\t* Enable the additional server debug logs [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/117547] for the following messages relevant to this behavior:\u00a0\n\n\t* Licensing Information\n\t* Crash Reporting\n\t* Packets Dropped For Some Reason\n\n\t* For crashes, please provide the Core dump file [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/116226]\u00a0located in any of the subfolders under /var/crash; for this, you need to access the SSH console [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/118062].\n\nHowever, we strongly recommend spinning up a new virtual machine and applying the license key there first.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60069509 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Alex,\n\nThank you for providing detailed information and screenshots regarding the licensing issue after your hardware replacement. Based on your description and the attached files, here is a comprehensive analysis and guidance to help resolve the problem:\n\nIssue Summary:\n\n \t* Your Kerio Control appliance is reporting \"Appliance does not have a valid license\" and \"The server is not responding\" when attempting to re-register or upload the license file.\n \t* The license number 20339-8W1L1-7HVWK is valid and not expired, and is correctly associated with your company.\n \t* You have replaced the firewall hardware, and the registration wizard fails with errors such as \"Unauthorized\" and \"The server is not responding.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\n \t* The screenshots confirm that the license is valid and active, but the appliance is unable to register or validate it online.\n \t* This situation commonly occurs after hardware replacement, as the license file is bound to the specific hardware serial number. If the license is still associated with the previous hardware, the new appliance will not accept it, resulting in the errors you are seeing.\n \t* The error messages \"Unauthorized\" and \"The server is not responding\" during the registration process further indicate a mismatch or communication issue between the appliance and the licensing server.\n\nRecommended Solution:\n\n\t* Obtain an Updated License File: \nSince the license is likely still associated with your old hardware, you will need to update the license to match your new appliance's serial number. This process is outlined in the following knowledge base articles: \n\n \t* License is not for this hardware [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120220] \n \t* Hardware box is not accepting license key [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120230] \n\n Key steps: \n\n \t* Visit the Kerio Product Registration page [https://registration.gfi.com/] and follow the wizard to download a new license file using your current hardware's serial number.\n \t* If you are unable to obtain the updated license file online, the articles above recommend contacting GFI Customer Care with your license key, new hardware serial number, and registration details to receive an updated license file.\n\n\t* Register the License Offline: \nOnce you have the correct license file for your new hardware: \n\n \t* In the Kerio Control Activation Wizard, select the option to register offline by license file.\n \t* Upload the new license.key file you obtained from the registration page or Customer Care.\n\nFor detailed steps, refer to the article: License Warning: there is no valid license for the product [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120182].\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n \t* If you continue to experience issues with the registration wizard or offline license upload, ensure your appliance has a stable internet connection and that the system date/time are correct.\n \t* If the problem persists after following the above steps, it may be necessary to wait a short period and retry, as temporary communication issues with the licensing server can sometimes occur.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need clarification on any of the steps above, please let us know and we will be happy to assist further.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - Kerio Control Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

Even just a brief description (like an error message, what you were trying to do, or when the problem started) will really help our support team assist you faster.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with your system today? \nAlex Fogerty:\n\n When I try to re-register it with AppManager I see the error message Appliance does not have a valid license but when I try to re-upload the license it says that The server is not responding \nChat Support:\n\n Thank you for the details! Just to confirm, here\u2019s what I understand so far:\n\n- When you try to re-register your Kerio Control appliance with AppManager, you get the error: Appliance does not have a valid license.\n- When you try to re-upload the license, you see: The server is not responding.\n- You\u2019re working with license key: 20339-8W1L1-7HVWK.\n\nBefore I connect you with a human agent, could you answer a couple of quick questions? This will help our support team assist you faster:\n\n1. Have you already gone through the Product Registration wizard, or does the error appear before you can complete it?\n2. Have you made any recent changes to your network, firewall, or Kerio Control configuration?\n3. Are you able to access the internet from the Kerio Control appliance itself (for example, can you ping external sites from the appliance)?\n4. Do you have any log files or screenshots of the error messages?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have this info handy, that\u2019s okay\u2014just let me know, and I\u2019ll proceed to connect you with a human agent. \nAlex Fogerty:\n\n (1) The Product Registration wizard fails, and uploading the license also fails.\n(2) We replaced the firewall hardware.\n(3) Yes, I'm connected to it remotely.\n(4) Yes. \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for the extra details\u2014this really helps! Since you recently replaced the firewall hardware, that\u2019s likely a key factor here. When hardware changes, Kerio Control may require a license reactivation or a hardware reset on the license, which can sometimes cause the errors you\u2019re seeing.\n\nCould you please upload the following to our secure portal (if you haven\u2019t already)?\n- A screenshot of the error messages you see during registration and license upload.\n- The relevant log files (especially the Error log, Warning log, and Debug log with the \u201cLicensing information\u201d and \u201cAppManager\u201d options enabled, if possible).\n\nHere\u2019s the upload link again for your convenience:\n\ud83d\udc49 Secure File Upload [https://files.eswsecuretransfers.com/customers?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzZXNzaW9uX3V1aWQiOiJjMDVhMzRkYS0xNTU1LTRlMzYtYTI5Yy1mOTUyNDU5YmMxMTUiLCJzZXNzaW9uX3VpZCI6ImMwNWEzNGRhLTE1NTUtNGUzNi1hMjljLWY5NTI0NTliYzExNSIsImVtYWlsIjoiYWxleEBsZWFkaW5nZWRnZGUiLCJjdXN0b21fcGFyc2VyIjp7fSwiY2FsbGJhY2siOnsiY2FsbGJhY2tfdXJsIjpudWxsLCJjYWxsYmFja19lbWFpbCI6ImNpcHJpYW4ubmFzdGFzZUB0cmlsb2d5LmNvbSJ9LCJwcm9kdWN0X3RhZyI6ImF1cmVhX2tlcmlvX2NvbnRyb2wiLCJxdWVyeSI6IiIsImV4cCI6MTc0OTE4MzQzM30.C69QsD7jwRyDU95NIkOys3XAMAbIAdXBVPY265GVM00]\n\nOnce you\u2019ve uploaded, let me know and I\u2019ll check for the analysis. If you\u2019d rather continue without uploading, just say so and I\u2019ll proceed to connect you with a human agent for further help.\n\nWould you like to upload those files, or should I go ahead and escalate this to a live agent for you? \nAlex Fogerty:\n\n Token-based Authentication Failed. Please attempt to login with username/password instead \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for letting me know about the token-based authentication error. That message usually means there\u2019s an issue with the authentication method being used\u2014sometimes related to changes in hardware or how the appliance is registered.\n\nLet\u2019s try to clarify a couple of things to help you (and our support team) get to a solution faster:\n\n1. Are you seeing this \u201cToken-based Authentication Failed\u201d message when trying to log in to the Kerio Control Webadmin, or is it during the AppManager registration process?\n2. Have you tried logging in with your username and password as the message suggests? If so, what happens\u2014do you get a different error, or does it let you in?\n3. Is this error appearing on the new hardware only, or did you see it before the hardware replacement as well?\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to proceed at all, or if you\u2019d prefer, I can escalate this to a live agent right away. Just let me know your preference! \nAlex Fogerty:\n\n I'm trying to upload the screenshots to you \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for letting me know you're uploading screenshots. At the moment, I don't see any files or analysis results available yet. Just a quick heads-up: I can't proactively monitor the upload progress, so you'll need to let me know once the upload is complete or if you run into any issues.\n\nOnce your files are uploaded, please let me know, and I'll check again for the analysis and help you move forward. If you have any questions or need help with the upload process, just ask! \nAlex Fogerty:\n\n I can't upload them because the link says the authentication token has failed \nChat Support:\n\n Ah, I see\u2014thanks for clarifying! If the secure upload link is giving you a \u201cToken-based Authentication Failed\u201d error, that means the upload session has expired or there\u2019s an issue with the link itself. Sorry about that\u2014it can definitely be frustrating when you\u2019re just trying to get help.\n\nHere\u2019s what we can do next:\n- I can request a new secure upload link for you, or\n- If you\u2019d prefer, I can escalate your case to a live agent right now and let them know you\u2019re unable to upload files due to the authentication error.\n\nWould you like me to get you a new upload link, or should I connect you directly with a human agent for further assistance? \nAlex Fogerty:\n\n Yes please \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for confirming! \ud83d\ude0a A human colleague will be happy to assist you further\u2014please feel free to choose from the available options to continue. \nAlex Fogerty:\n\n \ud83d\udcac Chat with live agent \nAlex Fogerty:\n\n undefined "
