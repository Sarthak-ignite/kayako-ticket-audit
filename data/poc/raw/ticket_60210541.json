          "Kayako - ticket id 60210541 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Jozef,\n\nThank you for detailing the issue encountered with Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificate renewal and VoIP trunk/PBX functionality on Kerio Control version 10 build 9018, which appears to resolve upon downgrading to 9.5 SP3. Based on the log details provided\u2014especially the timeout during the Let's Encrypt certificate authorization process\u2014the most likely root cause relates to firewall or network routing impacting connectivity during certificate validation.\n\nKey Information from Logs:\n\n \t* The validation attempt to access http://skillforge.it/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token> times out, which is commonly caused by network restrictions or routing/firewall issues.\n \t* Disabling IPS, GeoIP, Antivirus, and Application Filter does not resolve the issue, and Kerio logs show no direct errors.\n\nRecommended Steps:\n\n \t* Ensure that the PBX server and/or Kerio Control device have explicit firewall rules allowing incoming HTTP/HTTPS connections for Let's Encrypt ACME challenge URLs. These must not be blocked or proxied during certificate requests.\n \t* Verify that port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) are accessible from the internet to the PBX server for the duration of certificate issuance. Let's Encrypt must be able to reach http://skillforge.it/.well-known/acme-challenge/ without interference.\n \t* If you have SSL filtering or HTTPS inspection enabled, consider temporarily excluding Let's Encrypt domains and ACME challenge URLs, as SSL proxies can interfere with challenge validation.\n \t* If your PBX is behind Kerio Control using NAT, confirm that port-forwarding rules are in place and not blocked by any other rules. For more guidance on address exclusions and update services, refer to this article: IPS, GeoIP, Antivirus, Product update fails due to server connection issues [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/116491].\n \t* If problems persist only with version 10 and not on 9.5 SP3, review any changes in default firewall policies or NAT implementation introduced in the newer version and adjust rule sets as needed.\n\nAdditional Reference:\n\nFor advanced troubleshooting related to access issues, you may want to consult the article Troubleshooting Access Issues to Specific Websites through Kerio Control Firewall [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/119709], particularly regarding situations where external access is required and timing out.\n\nPlease review your Kerio Control firewall and NAT rules as described. By ensuring proper rule configuration and exclusions for ACME challenge validation, Let's Encrypt operations and VoIP trunks should function without such errors on Kerio Control version 10.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - Kerio Control Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.
