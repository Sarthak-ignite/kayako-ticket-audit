Let's focus on the issue: you're unable to open the license details tab on the GFI AppManager web interface.</p>\n      <p>To help you better, could you tell me a bit more about what happens when you try to open the license details tab? For example:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Do you see any error messages or does the page just not load?</li>\n        <li>Has this worked for you before, or is this your first time trying?</li>\n        <li>Are you experiencing this issue on all browsers/devices, or just one?</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>This info will help me narrow down the cause and guide you through the right troubleshooting steps.</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Nino Santiago) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>There are no error message and it's just not load. It's only showing a blank white screen.<br>\n      Yes, this has worked before.<br>\n      I'm experiencing issues on different browsers</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>Thanks for the details! Since the license details tab is showing a blank white screen (with no error message) and this happens across different browsers, it sounds like a user interface or user experience issue.</p>\n      <p>Let's try some basic troubleshooting steps first:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>Clear your browser cache and cookies</strong> \u2013 Sometimes cached data can cause display issues.</li>\n        <li><strong>Try Incognito/Private Mode</strong> \u2013 This disables most extensions and uses a clean session.</li>\n        <li><strong>Disable browser extensions</strong> \u2013 Especially ad blockers or privacy tools, as they can interfere with web apps.</li>\n        <li><strong>Check your internet connection</strong> \u2013 Make sure it's stable and not blocking any resources.</li>\n        <li><strong>Restart your device</strong> \u2013 Occasionally, a fresh start helps.</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>If you've already tried these steps or the issue persists, could you please provide:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Your Organization Name and AppManager Organization ID (you can find this in the URL when logged in, or follow <a href=\"https://support.appmanager.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/15726000408850\" rel=\"nofollow\">this guide</a>).\n        </li>\n        <li>The exact URL where the blank screen appears.</li>\n        <li>Any recent changes to your account or environment (e.g., new users, updates, etc.).</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>This info will help me check for any known issues and guide you further. If you prefer, you can also capture a HAR file or screenshot while reproducing the issue\u2014just let me know if you need instructions for that!</p>\n      <p>Let me know how you'd like to proceed!</p>\n    </div><br>\n  </div>"
