Let\u2019s dig into the issue where users are unable to approve emails and see a message that the email has been deleted or approved.<br><br>Based on our knowledge base, this can sometimes happen if the recipient of the quarantined email is a secondary email address (an alias or additional address, not the user\u2019s primary address). In these cases, users may not be able to approve or delete the email from their quarantine, but administrators can.<br><br>Here are a few questions to help narrow this down:<br>1. Are the affected users trying to approve emails where the recipient is a secondary (alias) email address, or is this happening for primary addresses as well?<br>2. Are administrators able to approve or delete these emails from the quarantine, or is the issue affecting admins too?<br>3. What version of GFI MailEssentials are you currently running?<br><br>This will help me determine if you\u2019re running into the known scenario described in this article: <a href=\"https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/119418\" target=\"_blank\">Emails cannot be approved nor deleted in the quarantine if the recipient is a secondary email address</a>.<br><br>Let me know about the above, and we\u2019ll figure out the next steps!<br><br><b>Stanley Wanyoike:</b><br>1. Primary, 2. admins can approve on mailessentials configuration. 3. version 21.8<br><br><b>Chat Support:</b><br>Thanks for the details! So, to recap:<br>- The issue happens for users with their <strong>primary</strong> email addresses.<br>- <strong>Admins</strong> can approve emails from the MailEssentials configuration.<br>- You're running <strong>version 21.8</strong>.<br><br>Since this isn't limited to secondary addresses and admins can approve, but regular users cannot, let's try a few targeted troubleshooting steps:<br><br>1. <strong>Browser/Cache Issue</strong>  <br>   Sometimes, the quarantine web interface can have session or cache issues.  <br>   - Could you ask one of the affected users to sign out of the quarantine portal, clear their browser cache, and sign back in?  <br>   - Does the issue persist after that?<br><br>2. <strong>User Permissions</strong>  <br>   - Have there been any recent changes to user permissions or Active Directory (if integrated)?  <br>   - Are all users affected, or just a subset?<br><br>3. <strong>Spam Quarantine Patch for 21.8</strong>  <br>   There is a known issue in version 21.8 where spam quarantine items may be blank or missing, and a patch is available to resolve related issues. Even if your items are visible, this patch may help with underlying quarantine problems.<br><br>   <strong>Please follow these steps:</strong><br>   1. Download the ZIP file: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DwRmJwXnNXS8hTHkkIChv8hpT3yPbZR/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Spam Quarantine Patch for 21.8</a><br>   2. Extract the contents to a preferred location.<br>   3. Right-click on `GFIPatchExecuter.exe` and choose \"Run as Administrator.\"<br>   4. In the patch tool, click \"Patch\" to deploy the update.<br>   5. Check if users can now approve emails from their quarantine.<br><br>Let me know the results after trying these steps, especially after applying the patch. If the issue persists, we\u2019ll dig deeper!"
