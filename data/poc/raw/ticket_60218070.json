Countless times this customer is asking whether there's any other way to license via DB because they can't see the screen. There's a whole discussion on whether to change the licensing endpoints, completely unnecessary I think.\u00a0 \n\n their HAR ends at GetProduct \n image\u00a0 \n\n But a good HAR (one that displays the licenses) will have one more call to GetLicenses, like this: \n image\u00a0 \n\n so it's not a network request issue. There must be some underlying issue at the server. Some conflicting extension, or botched upgrade. \n\n AI analysis: \n\nTICKET 60218070 \u2014 DNN/EVOQ LICENSING PAGE SHOWS BLANK SCREEN\n\nCONTEXT\n\n \t* Product: Evoq (response reports DNNCORP.XE / Evoq Content).\n \t* Symptom: Persona Bar \u2192 Licensing page renders blank.\n \t* Evidence gathered from HAR and DNN logs under logs/60218070/.\n\nKEY EVIDENCE\n\n\t* Persona Bar menu for Licensing returns no extensions (UI has nothing to render): \n\n \t* GET /API/personaBar/MenuExtensions/GetExtensions?menu=Dnn.Licensing \u2192 200 with body [].\n\n\t* Product lookup works (backend reachable and product recognized): \n\n \t* GET /API/PersonaBar/Licensing/GetProduct \u2192 200 with body {Success:true,Results:{Name:DNNCORP.XE,SKU:DNNENT,Description:Evoq Content}}.\n\n\t* Licensing assets loaded are for Dnn.Licensing (React bundle + init stub) and not the older EvoqLicensing assets: \n\n \t* /modules/Dnn.Licensing/scripts/Licensing.js loads /modules/dnn.licensing/scripts/bundles/licensing-bundle.js and renders into <div id=licensing-container .../>.\n\n\t* Historical log failures mention licensing data access callbacks and Azure SQL request limit exhaustion (not the immediate cause of a blank UI, but can affect licensing reads under load): \n\n \t* DotNetNuke.Professional.LicenseActivation.Licensing.LicenseController.GetLicenseListCallBack(...) in LogFailures.xml.resources with .Net SqlClient Data Provider stack traces and request limit reached messages.\n\nLIKELY ROOT CAUSE\n\n The site is loading the Dnn.Licensing Persona Bar module (which only calls GetProduct/GetServerInfo) instead of the Evoq Licensing UI that issues GetLicenses. In a working environment the browser loads EvoqLicensing.* assets and calls /API/PersonaBar/Licensing/GetLicenses. Here, those assets/calls are absent, so the page never progresses past the initial render, appearing blank. This points to an extension/version wiring mismatch (wrong licensing module registered or missing Evoq licensing package), not a network/API failure. \n\nIMPACT\n\n \t* Admin cannot view/manage licenses from Persona Bar (blank page).\n \t* License product detection still works; issue appears limited to the Persona Bar UI wiring for Licensing.\n\nRECOMMENDED ACTIONS (LEAST-CHANGE-FIRST)\n\n\t* Browser confirmation (which module is loaded) \n\n\t* In DevTools \u2192 Network on the Licensing page, confirm you see: \n\n \t* /modules/Dnn.Licensing/scripts/Licensing.js and /modules/dnn.licensing/scripts/bundles/licensing-bundle.js (current behavior), and NO EvoqLicensing.* files.\n \t* GET .../API/PersonaBar/Licensing/GetProduct returns 200 with product info.\n\n\t* Verify correct Licensing Persona Bar registration (UI first) \n\n\t* Go to Settings \u2192 Extensions \u2192 Persona Bar and check which licensing entry is installed: \n\n \t* For Evoq, you should have the Evoq Licensing module (files typically EvoqLicensing.*).\n \t* If the entry points to Dnn.Licensing, that\u2019s the wrong UI for Evoq and will not issue GetLicenses.\n\n \t* If Evoq Licensing is missing, reinstall/repair it from the matching Evoq version package.\n\n\t* Optional DB checks (read-only unless instructed) \n\n\t* Inspect which extension is bound to the Licensing menu: \n\n \t* SELECT * FROM PersonaBarMenu WHERE Identifier = 'Dnn.Licensing';\n \t* SELECT e.* FROM PersonaBarExtensions e JOIN PersonaBarMenu m ON e.MenuId = m.MenuId WHERE m.Identifier = 'Dnn.Licensing';\n\n \t* Validate the extension/folder paths point to Evoq licensing assets for Evoq editions. If they point to Dnn.Licensing, correct via reinstall/repair (apply only with approval).\n \t* After any change: clear DNN cache and recycle the application pool.\n\n\t* If Evoq Licensing extension is missing or mismatched \n\n \t* Reinstall/repair the Evoq Licensing Persona Bar extension from the same Evoq version package (avoid version mismatches).\n \t* Clear cache and recycle the app pool; re-test the Licensing page and confirm EvoqLicensing.* assets and GetLicenses requests appear.\n\n\t* If the page loads but license list fails to populate \n\n\t* Check web.config licensing HTTP module mapping aligns with the installed edition (per KB): \n\n \t* Evoq Basic \u2192 DotNetNuke.Professional.HttpModules.LicenseValidatorModule, DotNetNuke.Professional\n \t* Evoq Content \u2192 DotNetNuke.Enterprise.HttpModules.LicenseValidatorModule, DotNetNuke.Enterprise\n \t* Evoq Engage \u2192 DotNetNuke.SocialSolution.HttpModules.LicenseValidatorModule, DotNetNuke.SocialSolution\n\n \t* Confirm machine key stability; a changed key can invalidate the license hash.\n\n\t* Documented resets if licensing is stuck/corrupted (use only with DB backup and change approval) \n\n\t* Clear machine-key-bound hash to force re-activation: \n\n \t* DELETE FROM HostSettings WHERE SettingName = 'hash';\n\n\t* Clear stale license rows (then re-activate via UI): \n\n \t* DELETE FROM DNNPRO_License;\n\n \t* Then clear DNN cache, recycle app pool, and perform activation (automatic or manual offline).\n\n\t* If intermittent \n\n \t* Review SQL resource limits/timeouts; prior logs show Azure SQL request limit exhaustion. Coordinate with DBA for scaling or query load management if failures correlate with load.\n\nIS THERE A DOCUMENTED WAY TO RENEW VIA DATABASE?\n\n \t* No supported method to renew directly by inserting/updating license data in the DB.\n \t* Documented DB actions are strictly to clear stale state (HostSettings.hash, DNNPRO_License) to allow a clean re-activation via the UI (automatic or offline/manual).\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA\n\n \t* Evoq licensing assets (EvoqLicensing.*) load instead of Dnn.Licensing.\n \t* Browser shows /API/PersonaBar/Licensing/GetLicenses after GetProduct.\n \t* Licensing page renders and shows license details; activation/renewal actions are visible.\n\nNOTES\n\n \t* Keep changes minimal and version-aligned; avoid cross-version extension packages.\n \t* Always back up the DB before any direct update.\n \t* After changes, clear cache and recycle the app pool to ensure UI refresh.\n\n =============================================================== \n GPT \n Did you use GPT: Yes/No \n\n If No, add the reason below.

Actions completed: set remaining activations to 1 on all four licenses to unblock re-activation; verified HTTPS connectivity to https://dnnapi.com (customer confirms 200 OK); provided detailed Emergency License Activation steps inline due to customer-facing KB 404; requested console/network traces and DNN/server logs; advised IIS/app pool recycle, incognito testing, and disabling custom UI extensions; renewal side conversation sent to AM on 2025-10-09, pending authorization and new expiry date. Current blocker: License Management/Persona Bar Licenses page remains blank with no console/network errors reported; customer asks to meet via Zoom/Teams. Next step requires a human agent to join a live troubleshooting session, review browser dev tools in real-time, and possibly collect server-side logs/screenshares.

All necessary information will be provided here in this ticket.\n- Your servers need to reach only the licensing endpoint [https://dnnapi.com] over HTTPS (port 443, TLS 1.2). Viewing a blank page at this URL in a browser is typical, as it is an API.\n\nFor Emergency License Activation (manual/offline), please follow these instructions within DNN:\n1. Log in as Host/Superuser.\n2. Navigate to Persona Bar > Settings > Licenses.\n3. Select Add/Manage, then choose Emergency Activation.\n4. Pick the correct product/edition and input the license (invoice) number.\n5. Click Generate Request, then copy the entire Request blob.\n6. Reply to this ticket with the Request blob for each server (please specify the server, e.g., AZWEB17, AZWEB16, or DEV).\n7. We will return an Activation Response string for each. Paste it back into Emergency Activation and click Activate.\n8. Recycle the IIS app pool/site and confirm that the license appears valid on the Licenses page.\n\nIf issues persist with the Licenses page or emergency activation dialog:\n- Recycle the IIS app pool/site, and attempt again using an incognito/private browser window.\n- Temporarily disable custom extensions/themes that might influence the Persona Bar UI.\n- From the DNN server, verify:\n\u2022 curl -I dnnapi.com [https://dnnapi.com] returns HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\u2022 TLS 1.2 is enabled, and server time is accurately synchronized.\n- If still blank, please capture any messages from the browser Console and Network tabs and share the DNN/server logs from the effort.\n\nYour current license details are as follows, each having 1 remaining activation:\n- CS-CNTE-DEV-201603-20512-3 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15\n- CS-CNTE-PROD-201603-20512-3 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15\n- CS-CNTE-PROD-201603-20512-1 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15\n- CS-CNTE-DEV-201603-20512-1 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15\n\nRegistered servers:\n- AZWEB17 (PROD - 20512-3), AZWEB16 (PROD - 20512-1), SBOC-6sBLkpM74Z (DEV - 20512-1)\n\nRegarding renewal status:\n- We have contacted your Account Manager for authorization and the new expiry date. We will update you as soon as we receive confirmation.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Kindly send us the Emergency Activation Request blob(s) for each server, or provide Console/Network screenshots and any pertinent logs if the UI remains unresponsive. We will promptly provide the Activation Response(s) or additional guidance.\n\nBest regards,\nCentral Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.

Here are some clarifications and next steps for you:\n\n1) **Licensing Endpoint:** Please ensure you use only dnnapi.com [https://dnnapi.com] (13.91.55.249). It's normal for it to appear blank in a browser as it\u2019s an API. Please do not switch to dnnapi.org, and note that HTTP/port 80 is not necessary for licensing; HTTPS on port 443 will suffice.\n\n2) **Connectivity Checks (from the DNN server):**\n- Use: Test-NetConnection dnnapi.com -Port 443\n- Or: curl -I https://dnnapi.com (expect HTTP/1.1 200 OK)\n- Ensure TLS 1.2 is enabled, server time is accurately synced, DNS settings are not overridden, and there are no SSL inspection or proxy blocks affecting outbound HTTPS to dnnapi.com.\n\n3) **If the License Page Remains Blank:**\n- Recycle the app pool or restart the site and test using an incognito browser.\n- Capture any errors in the browser's Console and Network tabs.\n- Share relevant DNN and server logs from the time of the attempt.\n- Temporarily disable any custom extensions that might impact the admin UI for testing purposes.\n\n4) **Emergency License Activation:** Kindly refer to the official guide [https://dnnsupport.dnnsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006325634-Emergency-License-Activation-Process].

We appreciate your feedback as it is very helpful.\n\nHere are several important points to consider:\n\n- Kindly refrain from changing any endpoints to dnnapi.org. The only supported licensing endpoint is dnnapi.com [https://dnnapi.com] (resolves to 13.91.55.249). \n- Observing a blank page when visiting dnnapi.com [https://dnnapi.com] in a browser is normal, as it is an API. The crucial factor is that your DNN server can access it.\n- HTTPS port 443 is used for licensing. HTTP port 80 is unnecessary\u2014if HTTPS is functioning, port 80 does not need to be opened.\n- Ensure that the server clock is accurate and synchronized via NTP, as significant clock discrepancies can disrupt TLS and other validations.\n\nPlease attempt the following checks from the DNN server:\n\n- Execute Test-NetConnection dnnapi.com -Port 443\n- Use the command curl -I https://dnnapi.com (you should receive an HTTP/1.1 200 OK response with a minimal or empty body).\n- Recycle the DNN app pool or restart the site, then open the License page in an incognito window.\n\nIf the License page remains blank, kindly provide us with the following:\n\n- Any errors recorded in the browser Console and Network tab (particularly failed requests to persona bar resources or dnnapi.com).\n- Relevant DNN and server logs during the time the page is loaded.\n- Optionally, a redacted snippet of any web.config keys that reference licensing/endpoints for our validation.\n\nTo facilitate re-activation, an extra activation has been added to each of your licenses:\n\n- CS-CNTE-DEV-201603-20512-3 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-PROD-201603-20512-3 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-PROD-201603-20512-1 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-DEV-201603-20512-1 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n\nShould the user interface fail to load for removal or re-addition, you may proceed with the Emergency License Activation Process and notify us for validation.\n\nRegarding renewal, we have contacted your Account Manager for authorization of the new expiration date and will update you once confirmation is received.\n\nPlease keep us informed about the results of the above checks, and do not hesitate to share the web.config snippet for our review.\n\nBest regards,\nCentral Support Team"

Note that 'dnnapp.com' seems to be a typographical error.\n- dnnapi.org (37.97.190.178) is not utilized for our licensing service and should therefore be avoided.\n- Normally, no alterations should be made to the license endpoints within the web.config. If you notice any custom references, you are welcome to share a redacted snippet with us for confirmation.\n\nTo verify connectivity from the DNN server, you might run:\n- PowerShell commands: Test-NetConnection dnnapi.com -Port 80 and Test-NetConnection dnnapi.com -Port 443\n- Curl commands: curl -I http://dnnapi.com and curl -I https://dnnapi.com (you should receive a 200 OK with a minimal or empty body)\n- Confirm that TLS 1.2 is enabled and ensure outbound HTTPS to dnnapi.com is not interrupted by SSL inspection or blocked by a proxy/firewall. It is also important to verify the server clock's accuracy.\n\nIf the License page remains blank after confirming connectivity, please share:\n- Any errors from the browser console (F12) when opening the License page\n- Relevant logs from both DNN and the server\n\nFor your assistance with re-activation, we have already added an additional activation to each of your current licenses:\n- CS-CNTE-DEV-201603-20512-3 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-PROD-201603-20512-3 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-PROD-201603-20512-1 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-DEV-201603-20512-1 \u2014 Valid until 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n\nLinked servers: AZWEB17 (PROD -20512-3), AZWEB16 (PROD -20512-1), SBOC-6sBLkpM74Z (DEV -20512-1).\n\nRegarding your renewal status, we have reached out to your Account Manager for authorization and the approval of the new expiration date; we will update you as soon as we receive confirmation.\n\nPlease forward the test outcomes and any console or log errors, and we will proceed accordingly.\n\nBest regards,\nCentral Support Team"

When accessed directly via a browser, it might appear as a blank page; however, the key factor is that your DNN server can connect to it.\n\nHere's a checklist to ensure connectivity from your DNN web server:\n- **DNS:** Ensure that dnnapi.com resolves to 13.91.55.249 without any hosts file overrides.\n- **Network:** Permit outbound connections to dnnapi.com and 13.91.55.249 on ports 80 and 443, making sure there are no SSL interceptions or proxy blocks.\n- **Quick Tests from Server:**\n- For Windows, use: `Test-NetConnection dnnapi.com -Port 80` and `Test-NetConnection dnnapi.com -Port 443`\n- Alternatively, use: `curl -v http://dnnapi.com/` and `curl -v https://dnnapi.com/`\n- **System Prerequisites:** Ensure TLS 1.2 is enabled and that the server clock/timezone is accurate.\n\nIf connectivity is established but the License Management page remains blank, please try the following:\n1. Restart the DNN site and access the License page using a fresh or incognito browser session.\n2. Refer to our guide on renewing your DNN license [https://dnnsupport.dnnsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017203139-Renewing-your-DNN-license-on-your-environment] in your environment.\n3. If the list still doesn\u2019t render, remove the current license entry and add it again (refer to Solution #2 [https://supportportal.cloudsense.com/conversation/view/2] in the article).\n4. If you are unable to remove/re-add, please use the Emergency License Activation Process [https://dnnsupport.dnnsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006325634-Emergency-License-Activation-Process] and notify us for validation.\n\nThe current license status for State Bar of California (calbar.ca.gov) is as follows:\n- CS-CNTE-DEV-201603-20512-3 \u2014 Valid Until: 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-PROD-201603-20512-3 \u2014 Valid Until: 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-PROD-201603-20512-1 \u2014 Valid Until: 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n- CS-CNTE-DEV-201603-20512-1 \u2014 Valid Until: 2025-10-15 \u2014 Remaining Activations: 1\n\nRegarding renewal, we have requested your Account Manager to authorize the extension and confirm the new expiration date.

Let's try to get this sorted out.\n\nHere are some steps and checks that often resolve this type of issue: \n-------------------------\n\n1. RESTART THE APPLICATION & CLEAR BROWSER CACHE\n\nSometimes, a blank screen can be caused by server or client-side caching issues. Please try the following:\n\n \t* Restart the DNN application (you can do this from the server or by touching the web.config file).\n \t* Clear your browser cache or open the license page in an incognito/private browsing window.\n \t* Try accessing the license management screen again.\n\n-------------------------\n\n2. CHECK DNN VERSION & PERSONA BAR ISSUES\n\nIf you\u2019re running an early 9.6 version of DNN, there\u2019s a known issue where the Persona Bar (which includes the license management area) may not load due to invalid menu identifiers. If this matches your setup, you may need to update the menu identifiers. More details are available in this article:\n\n \t* Troubleshooting License Activation Issues [https://dnnsupport.dnnsoftware.com/article/54094] \n\n-------------------------\n\n3. NETWORK & MICROSERVICES CONNECTIVITY\n\nDNN\u2019s license management sometimes requires access to external services.
