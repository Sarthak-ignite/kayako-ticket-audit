I understand that after installing GFI MailEssentials version 22.2, EML files are piling up in the Replay folder. That definitely sounds frustrating, and I want to help you get to the bottom of it.<br>\n      <br>\n      This kind of issue is often related to mail flow problems after an upgrade, where emails aren't being processed as expected. Here are some steps and resources that can help:<br>\n      <br>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Sometimes, after an upgrade, certain files or services may not be working correctly, causing emails to get stuck in the Replay folder. Reinstalling MailEssentials with the latest installer can resolve this. You can find detailed steps in this article: <a href=\"https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117960\" rel=\"nofollow\">MailEssentials is not scanning emails</a>.\n        </li>\n      </ol><br>\n      <br>\n      <ol>\n        <li>If you notice that the Dashboard logs aren't updating and queues are building up, you might need to purge the Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus Scan Engine queues. This process is safe and won't result in lost emails. Instructions are available here: <a href=\"https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/118326\" rel=\"nofollow\">Purging the Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus Scan Engine Message Queues</a>.\n        </li>\n      </ol><br>\n      <br>\n      Before we proceed, could you let me know:<br>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Are you seeing any errors in the MailEssentials dashboard or Windows Event Viewer?</li>\n        <li>Is mail flow otherwise normal, or are emails delayed/not delivered?</li>\n        <li>Did you perform an in-place upgrade, or was this a fresh install?</li>\n      </ul><br>\n      <br>\n      Once I have this info, I can guide you through the most relevant troubleshooting steps!\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Ebenezer Lah Ampene) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      Ticket ID: #6021844\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      Just to confirm... you are asking for information or an update on a previous ticket you raised with us, correct?\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Ebenezer Lah Ampene) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <em>Button selection:</em> [\u2705 Yes, correct]\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      Here is a link for you:<br>\n      <br>\n      \ud83d\udc49<a href=\"https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/conversation/view/6021844\" rel=\"nofollow\">6021844</a><br>\n      <br>\n      There you can check its status, follow up on it, and escalate it if its not closed.<br>\n      <br>\n      Also, you can see all your GFI MailEssentials tickets <a href=\"https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/conversations\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br>\n      <br>\n      Are you able to open the above link?\n    </div><br>\n  </div>"
