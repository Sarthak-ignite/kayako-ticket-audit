In the Information section, GFI still reports version 22.2 (Build 20250729).\n- Again, why is this version displayed?\n\nWould it be advisable or even possible to roll back to version 21.8, since that version was stable and functional?\n\nFinally, our partner asked if we can plan a remote session together with one of your technicians.\nThe customer has been without email protection for about a week now, so we really need to get this issue fixed soon.\n\n\nThanks a lot for your help!\nBest regards"

          "Kayako - ticket id 60218313 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Support,\n\nThank you for your update and for confirming that all suggested troubleshooting steps have already been performed. I have reviewed the detailed information provided and the diagnostics from your screenshots. Below is a comprehensive overview and targeted guidance based on the persistent issues with the Virus Scanning Engine (VSE) \u201cFailed [VSE]\u201d error and the \"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\" message in the Email Security/Content Filtering section.\n\nCurrent Situation Based on Your Diagnostics:\n\n \t* GFI MailEssentials version: 22.2 (build 20250813) is installed, and the affected area is the Information Store Protection (VSAPI) under Email Security.\n \t* VSE failure: Multiple AV engines (BitDefender, Avira, Sophos) are licensed and listed, but scan results return \u201cFehlgeschlagen [VSE]\u201d (Failed [VSE]) for internal emails, which indicates a failure at the scanning engine level.\n \t* UI configuration error: When accessing the Information Store Protection settings, the error \u201cDer Objektverweis wurde nicht auf eine Objektinstanz festgelegt\u201d (\"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\") is consistently encountered, blocking access to critical configuration pages.\n\nRelevant Findings from Knowledge Base and Analysis:\n\n \t* Article references confirm that \u201cFailed [VSE]\u201d errors result when an antivirus engine within MailEssentials fails to load, fails to update, or develops corruption\u2014as documented in this article [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117808].\n \t* The persistent \u201cObject reference not set...\u201d error is generally attributed to a corrupted configuration, missing or problematic dependencies (often SQL Server Compact), or deeper corruption in the information store engine module. This is supported by this guidance article [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/116264] and this update-related article [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117797].\n \t* When neither a repair nor a reinstallation resolves such errors, and all isolation/troubleshooting steps (AV exclusions, folder checks, fresh installs, component reinstalls) fail, it indicates an issue potentially outside the scope of standard troubleshooting\u2014frequently only resolved by upgrading to the latest product build (where bugfixes are implemented) or disabling the problematic scan engine as a long-term workaround.\n\nRecommended Next Steps Based on All Diagnostic Info and Documentation:\n\n \t* If you are not on the absolute latest build of GFI MailEssentials, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to the newest available version. Many unresolved or persistent VSE and configuration errors are addressed in subsequent product updates. For further instructions, refer to Mailflow stops with Failed VSE error on ME 20.3 [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117660]. \n\n\t* If updating is not possible (license, OS, or environment limitations), and the error persists after all standard steps: \n\n \t* Keep all but the essential Virus Scanning Engines enabled and permanently disable the problematic engine(s) if identified, as referenced in Bitdefender fails to initialise, emails are failing with Failed VSE [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117679].\n \t* If the configuration UI prevents you from disabling the engines or making changes, and repair/reinstall does not restore UI functionality, this confirms a deeper corruption which, per the knowledge base, requires a product upgrade or a new installation for resolution.\n\n \t* Additional Review: Review the Windows Event Viewer for related application or system errors at the time the issues occur. This might provide more detail if a particular DLL or dependency is failing to load\u2014information that is useful for deciding if further operating system troubleshooting is required. \n\nReferences:\n\n \t* Virus Scanning Engine Generates 'Scan Result: Failed [VSE]' Error [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117808]\n \t* Mailflow stops with Failed VSE error on ME 20.3 [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117660]\n \t* AntiVirus Updates Fail with Message: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object' [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117797]\n \t* Bitdefender fails to initialise, emails are failing with Failed VSE [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117679]\n\nIf after an upgrade the issues persist, or the configuration UI remains inaccessible despite a completely fresh reinstall with the latest build, this would confirm an environmental factor or unsupported scenario. At that stage, re-evaluating the operating environment or performing a full server backup and clean install may be required to fully restore functionality.\n\nPlease let us know if you have upgraded to the most recent version and whether this approach brings the Email Security/Content Filtering functionality back online.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - MailEssentials Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60218313 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Support,\n\nThank you for providing detailed feedback, screenshots, and a summary of the ongoing issue with GFI MailEssentials after your recent reinstall on your Exchange server. Based on your report and the attached images, there are two main symptoms: (1) Virus Scanning Engine (VSE) failures resulting in \"Scan Result: Failed [VSE]\" for emails, and (2) an \u201cunexpected error\u201d in the configuration interface, which prevents you from accessing email security/content filtering functions with error details such as \"Der Objektverweis wurde nicht auf eine Objektinstanz festgelegt\" (\"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\").\n\n1. Addressing the \"Failed [VSE]\" and AV Engine Errors:\n\nThis issue usually indicates that one of the antivirus engines failed to load properly or is unable to update. Common causes include permission issues on temp folders, AV conflicts, or update failures. The following steps are recommended:\n\n \t* Ensure that temporary folders (%temp% and C:\\Windows\\Temp) are not full and are accessible. You may want to clear them.\n \t* Make sure no other antivirus product is interfering with the folders: \nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\GFI \nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\GFI \n \t* Add firewall exclusions for update servers such as update.gfi.com, meupdate.gfi.com, and the other domains listed in the following article: \nVirus Scanning Engine Generates 'Scan Result: Failed [VSE]' Error [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117808] \n \t* If the problem persists, temporarily disable the Virus Scanning Engines one by one in the MailEssentials configuration UI (under Email Security > Virus Scanning Engines) to identify which engine is causing the failure. Once identified, you can leave the problematic engine disabled as a short-term workaround while the root cause is further investigated.\n\nFor reference and detailed steps, please see: Virus Scanning Engine Generates 'Scan Result: Failed [VSE]' Error [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117808]\n\n2. Resolving 'Unexpected Error' when Accessing Email Security/Content Filtering:\n\nThe error message and stack trace (\"Object reference not set to an instance of an object\") strongly resemble a known issue that can be caused by a missing or corrupted SQL Server Compact component or by engine/configuration corruption.\n\nWorkaround:\n\n \t* Make sure SQL Server Compact 3.5 is installed and correctly registered. If missing or corrupted, you can download and reinstall it from the official Microsoft site as described here:\n \t* Error: 'An unexpected error occurred in GFI MailEssentials configuration' [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/116264]\n \t* After installation, restart the GFI MailEssentials services and attempt to access the relevant configuration page again.\n \t* If the product version is outdated or issues persist, upgrading to the latest version of MailEssentials is strongly recommended, as many critical issues are resolved in newer versions.\n\nSummary of Steps:\n\n \t* Clear and check permissions on the server's temp folders.\n \t* Set antivirus and firewall exclusions for GFI folders and update servers.\n \t* Identify and temporarily disable any problematic Virus Scanning Engine.\n \t* Verify and reinstall SQL Server Compact 3.5 if necessary.\n \t* Upgrade GFI MailEssentials to the latest available build if the problem persists.\n\nReferences for your convenience:\n\n \t* Scan Result: Failed [VSE] Error \u2013 Troubleshooting Steps [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/117808]\n \t* Unexpected Error in GFI MailEssentials configuration [https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/116264]\n\nIf you still encounter issues after these steps, please note any specific AV engine causing the problem or any changes in the error messages, as this may help narrow down the root cause.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - MailEssentials Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.
