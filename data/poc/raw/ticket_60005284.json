I understand you're looking to start the RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) process for a faulty Kerio Control device. I'll guide you through the steps to initiate this process.\n\nFirst, let's ensure we've completed the necessary prerequisites:\n\n1. Troubleshooting:\n- Have you performed a factory reset on the device?\n- If the factory reset didn't resolve the issue, did you attempt a complete system recovery using kerio-control-rescue?\n- For guidance on these steps, please refer to Restoring the Kerio Control Box NG series default configuration.\n\n2. Observation:\nAfter performing these steps, it's important to observe the box's behavior for a couple of hours to confirm that it's still not functioning correctly.\n\n3. Diagnostic Logs:\nIf possible, gather diagnostic logs from the device using the Diagnostic tool for Kerio Control Box NG series.\n\nAssuming you've completed these steps and the device is still faulty, here's what you need to do to start the RMA process:\n\n1. Prepare a detailed description of the symptoms and issues you're experiencing with the hardware.\n\n2. Record a video showing the physical problem or unexpected behavior. This is a required step for the RMA process.\n\n3. Gather the following information:\n- Serial Number (located on the back of the unit)\n- Company name\n- Contact name\n- Contact phone number\n- Contact email address\n- Shipping Address (including Address, Zip Code, City, and Country)\n\n4. Compile the diagnostic logs (if generated) into a zip file.\n\nOnce you have all this information ready, you'll need to provide it to Kerio Control Support. To do this, please ask for a support agent in this chat. They will be able to process your RMA request and guide you through the next steps.\n\nRemember, after you receive the replacement box, you'll need to send the faulty device back to the address provided by the support team.\n\nIs there anything else you need clarification on regarding this process?\n\n-------------------------\n\nFor more details check:\n\ud83d\udc49 Requesting RMA for hardware box [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120394] \nChat Support:\n\n Take all the time you need to read through the provided resources \u261d\ufe0f\nI'll stay here in case you need anything else \ud83d\ude00\n\n-------------------------\n\nWas this helpful? \nDanijel Knezic:\n\n LNKR24070037 \nChat Support:\n\n You did not use the provided buttons to let me know, so I assume that my previous answer was helpful but you have a follow-up question.\n\ud83e\udde0 Working on an answer for that ... \nChat Support:\n\n Thank you for providing the serial number LNKR24070037.
