          "Kayako - ticket id 60267287 // Randall Shawver commented publicly: Hello Kevin,\n\nThank you for the updated logs and the Outlook registry exports.\n\nFrom your Import/Export Tool logs, we can see two separate issues:\n\n\t* When importing from PST files, the tool is failing with the internal error Wrong OS or OS version for application (0x800401FA) right after you add the PST.\n\t* When you try to import directly from Office 365, the tool is sometimes failing to establish a secure TLS connection and, in one case, tries to look up a mailbox with an empty alias.\n\n1. FIXING THE PST IMPORT CRASH (RECOMMENDED FIRST)\n\nThe PST import crash is caused by how the Import/Export Tool detects Outlook on newer Outlook versions.\nEven though your registry correctly shows Outlook 2019 x64 under:\n\n\t* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\nwith\u00a0Bitness = \"x64\"\n\nthe tool also expects a \u201cbitness\u201d key under the 15.0 branch for Outlook 2016 and later. When that key is missing, the tool cannot recognize 64\u2011bit Outlook and behaves as if no compatible Outlook is installed, which leads to the 0x800401FA error during PST operations.\n\nPlease do the following on the server where you run the Import/Export Tool:\n\n\t* Open regedit as Administrator.\n\n\t* Browse to:\n\n\t* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\n\n\t* If the Outlook key does not exist under 15.0, create it:\n\n\t* Right\u2011click 15.0 \u2192 New \u2192 Key \u2192 name it Outlook.\n\n\t* Inside HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Outlook:\n\n\t* Right\u2011click in the right pane \u2192 New \u2192 String Value.\n\t* Name the value Bitness.\n\t* Set the Value data to x64.\n\n\t* Close the Registry Editor.\n\t* Start Outlook once to confirm it opens normally, then close Outlook.\n\n\t* Run the 64\u2011bit Import/Export Tool:\n\n\t* C:\\Program Files\\GFI\\Archiver\\MarcImportExport\\MArcImportExport_x64.exe\n\n\t* Try \u201cImport from .pst files\u201d again and add the same PST.\n\nIf this key is in place, the tool should now recognize Outlook as 64\u2011bit and stop asking you to switch to the 32\u2011bit version. The \u201cUnknown error, application will be closed\u201d after adding the PST should also be resolved.\n\nIf you still see a crash after these steps, please re\u2011run the operation and then send us the updated versions of the following logs from ..\\GFI\\Archiver\\MarcImportExport\\DebugLogs\\:\n\n\t* UCMainPage.log\n\t* ExportUI.log\n\t* ExchPstExport.log\n\nso we can confirm whether the detection is now correct.\n\n2. IMPORTING DIRECTLY FROM OFFICE 365 (ALTERNATIVE PATH)\n\nYou also asked if there is a way to import directly from an Office 365 account instead of using PST files. Yes \u2013 you can import directly from Exchange Online using the \u201cImport from Microsoft Exchange Mailbox\u201d mode in the Import/Export Tool.\n\nFrom your latest logs, when you tried Exchange Online you hit:\n\n\t* The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.\n\nThis usually means the .NET framework on the import server is not yet configured to use TLS 1.2 with Exchange Online.\n\nOn the machine where you run the Import/Export Tool, please:\n\n\t* Open PowerShell as Administrator.\n\t* Run these commands to enable strong TLS for .NET. Hit Enter a few times to ensure they are all applied.\n\nNew-ItemProperty\u00a0-path\u00a0'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NetFramework\\v4.0.30319'\u00a0-name\u00a0'SchUseStrongCrypto'\u00a0-value\u00a0'1'\u00a0-PropertyType\u00a0'DWord'\u00a0-Force\u00a0|\u00a0Out-Null\nNew-ItemProperty\u00a0-path\u00a0'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NetFramework\\v4.0.30319'\u00a0-name\u00a0'SchUseStrongCrypto'\u00a0-value\u00a0'1'\u00a0-PropertyType\u00a0'DWord'\u00a0-Force\u00a0|\u00a0Out-Null\nNew-ItemProperty\u00a0-path\u00a0'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NetFramework\\v4.0.30319'\u00a0-name\u00a0'SystemDefaultTlsVersions'\u00a0-value\u00a0'1'\u00a0-PropertyType\u00a0'DWord'\u00a0-Force\u00a0|\u00a0Out-Null\nNew-ItemProperty\u00a0-path\u00a0'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\.NetFramework\\v4.0.30319'\u00a0-name\u00a0'SystemDefaultTlsVersions'\u00a0-value\u00a0'1'\u00a0-PropertyType\u00a0'DWord'\u00a0-Force\u00a0|\u00a0Out-Null\n\n\t* Restart the server.\n\n\t* In the Import/Export Tool, choose\u00a0Import from Microsoft Exchange Mailbox, and then:\n\n\t* Select\u00a0Microsoft Exchange Online (Exchange/Microsoft 365).\n\t* Use an account that has the required\u00a0ApplicationImpersonation permissions in Exchange Online.\n\t* Point the server field to:\nhttps://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx\n\n\t* When selecting the mailbox to import, make sure you pick an existing mailbox (via the \u201c\u2026\u201d picker), so the alias is not blank.\n\nYou can find the full step\u2011by\u2011step guide for the Exchange Online import here:\n[4]\n\n3. WHAT WE SUGGEST DOING FIRST\n\nBecause your main blocker is the PST import crash, we recommend:\n\n\t* Apply the small registry change to add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Outlook\\Bitness = x64.\n\t* Re\u2011test the 64\u2011bit Import/Export Tool with your PST.\n\n\t* If that still fails, we can then either:\n\n\t* Focus on getting the Office 365 import path working, or\n\t* Move the PST import to a clean Outlook 2019 x64 workstation and run the Import/Export Tool from there.\n\nPlease let us know the result after you add the 15.0\\Outlook\\Bitness key and try the 64\u2011bit Import/Export Tool again, and feel free to attach fresh logs if the issue persists.\n\nReferences\n\n\t* Importing Emails in GFI Archiver [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/105276]\n\t* Setting Permissions for Importing Emails from Microsoft Exchange 2010 or 2013 [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/106040]\n\t* Configuring EWS OAuth Authentication with GFI Archiver [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/106310]\n\t* Importing Emails from Exchange [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/106459]\n\t* Archiver Requirements for Microsoft Outlook or CDO/MAPI [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/106484]\n\t* Resolving Connection Errors to Journal Mailbox in GFI Archiver After Migrating to Exchange Online [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/123713]\n\t* Resolving COMException Error When Exporting GFI Archiver to PST [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/128979]\n\nBest regards,\nRandall Shawver\nGFI - Archiver Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.

The crash and the OutlookIsX64 detection failure suggest\u00a0conflicting\u00a032-bit and 64-bit Outlook\u00a0installations\u00a0or MAPI configuration issues. The registry shows\u00a0Outlook 16.0\u00a0as x64, but\u00a0the tool cannot\u00a0detect it, which often\u00a0indicates a\u00a0conflict. Please check for conflicting Outlook installations: \n\n Check for multiple Outlook installations by verifying both\u00a0Program Files locations: \n\n \t* Open File Explorer and navigate to: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\n \t* Check\u00a0if OUTLOOK.EXE\u00a0exists there\u00a0(this would be\u00a064-bit Outlook)\n \t* Then navigate to: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\n \t* Check if OUTLOOK.EXE\u00a0exists there (this would be\u00a032-bit Outlook)\n \t* If you find Outlook in both\u00a0locations,\u00a0you have both\u00a032-bit and\u00a064-bit installations, which can cause conflicts\n\n Check registry entries for multiple Office versions: \n\n \t* Open Registry\u00a0Editor (regedit.exe)\n \t* Navigate to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\n \t* Check if\u00a0you see both\u00a015.0 and 16.0 folders\n \t* If both exist, check the Outlook\\Bitness value in each:\n \t* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\Outlook\\Bitness\n \t* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Outlook\\Bitness\n \t* Note what values are set in each\n\n \t* Also check:\u00a0HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Clients\\Mail\\Microsoft Outlook (if it exists, this could indicate a\u00a032-bit installation)\n\n If you find conflicting installations, resolve them: If both 32-bit and 64-bit Outlook are installed: \n\n \t* Uninstall the\u00a032-bit version\u00a0if you only need 64-bit Outlook\n \t* Or ensure only one version is set as the default mail client\n \t* Run the MAPI fix utility: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: C:\\Windows\\System32\\fixmapi.exe\n\n If registry entries conflict: \n\n \t* Ensure only one Office version (preferably 16.0) has\u00a0Outlook configured\n \t* Verify the Bitness value matches your actual Outlook installation\n \t* If Office 15.0 entries\u00a0exist and conflict, you may need to remove or update them\n\n After resolving conflicts: \n\n \t* Restart the server\n \t* Verify Outlook\u00a0opens correctly\n \t* Try running the Import/Export Tool again\n\n Once the tool is working, you can import\u00a0directly from\u00a0Office 365 without using PST files. This avoids PST handling issues. To do this, select Import from Microsoft Exchange Mailbox instead of Import from PST File when\u00a0you open the\u00a0tool, then\u00a0configure the connection to https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx with your\u00a0Office 365 credentials. \n\n If the issue persists, please\u00a0Gather Troubleshooter Logs for Archiver [https://gfi-archiver-supportdesk.kayako.com/article/106126-gathering-troubleshooter-logs-for-archiver]\u00a0and share the logs here. \n\n Best regards, \n Shaquille De Lancy \n GFI - Archiver Support Team \n =============================================================== \n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT?\n\n Keys show mapi32.dll and msmapi32.dll but both of these can be 64 bit version. Can't tell by name. "

          "Kayako - ticket id 60267287 // Pavly Nashed commented publicly: Dear Kevin,\nFor importing from .PST using the GFI Archiver Import/Export Tool, Microsoft Outlook must be installed on the machine where the tool is running. If Outlook is not detected, the PST import/export options are disabled. So there isn\u2019t a supported way to import PSTs \u201cwithout Outlook\u201d on the machine running the tool.\nIf you want to avoid installing Outlook on the GFI Archiver application server, the supported approach is to run the Import/Export Tool from a separate machine that has Outlook installed (for example, one of your two servers with Outlook 2019) and can reach the Archiver server. Please also ensure you run the correct Import/Export installer/executable for the Outlook bitness (32-bit vs 64-bit), as the recommended version depends on the Outlook bit version installed.\nSince the tool is crashing after adding PST files, please send us:\n\n\t* The Import/Export debug log:\u00a0...\\GFI\\Archiver\\MarcImportExport\\DebugLogs\\ExchPstExport.log\u00a0(and any other logs from the same\u00a0DebugLogs\u00a0folder around the crash time)\n\t* The Windows\u00a0Application\u00a0Event Viewer entries at the time of the crash (for the failing process/module)\n\t* Your GFI Archiver version/build, and Outlook version + whether it\u2019s 32-bit or 64-bit on the machine running the tool\n\nIf installing Outlook anywhere is not an option, the alternative supported method is importing mail directly from Exchange mailboxes using the Import/Export Tool (instead of importing from PST files).\n\nReferences:\n\n\t* Import Export Tool [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/106378]\n\t* Importing emails from exchange [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/106459]\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further inquiries.\nBest regards,\nPavly Nashed\nGFI - Archiver Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.

I can see you're getting an Unknown error has occurred. Application will be closed message when trying to use the GFI Archiver Import and Export Tool to import PST files. That's definitely frustrating! \ud83d\ude1f\n\nLet me ask you a few questions to help narrow this down:\n\nWhat specific error message or behavior do you see? I can see from your screenshot it says Unknown error, but are there any other details in the logs or does it happen at a specific point (like when you click Add to select PST files, or after you've already added them)? \n\n--- Customer (Kevin Gragert) ---\n\n after adding pst files \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Got it! So the tool crashes right after you add the PST files. This is a known issue that can happen with the Import/Export Tool, and it's typically related to the Microsoft Outlook installation on the server.\n\nGFI Archiver relies on Microsoft Outlook to handle PST file processing. Based on what I'm seeing, here are the most common causes and solutions:\n\nRECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS:\n\n1. UPDATE MICROSOFT OUTLOOK & SYSTEM COMPONENTS\n\nMake sure you have the latest updates installed for:\n\n \t* Microsoft Outlook (latest service pack and patches)\n \t* Microsoft Windows (latest service pack and patches)\n \t* Microsoft .NET Framework (latest service pack and patches)\n\n2. USE 64-BIT OUTLOOK (RECOMMENDED)\n\nIf possible, use a 64-bit version of Microsoft Outlook rather than 32-bit. Also, newer versions of Outlook (like 2013, 2016, or later) tend to work better than older versions like Outlook 2003.\n\n3. TEMPORARILY DISABLE ANTIVIRUS\n\nAntivirus software can sometimes interfere with PST file operations. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus during the import process.\n\n4. REDUCE SYSTEM LOAD\n\n \t* Close other applications that might be using significant resources\n \t* Avoid running the import during system backups or other maintenance tasks\n\nYou can find more details in this article: Archiver Tool Crashes When Exporting PST Files [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/106025]\n\nQuick question: What version of Microsoft Outlook do you have installed on the Archiver server, and is it 32-bit or 64-bit? \n\n--- Customer (Kevin Gragert) ---\n\n please create support ticket \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I understand you'd like to create a support ticket, and a human colleague will be happy to assist you with that! \ud83d\ude0a Please feel free to choose from the available options to connect with a live agent. \n\n--- Customer (Kevin Gragert) ---\n\n Button selection: [\ud83d\udce9 Raise a ticket] \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Please provide any other additional details we might need to investigate and resolve your issue.\n\nYou can use Shift+Enter if you want to continue typing in a new line.\n\nFor now, I am unable to take any file uploads, so any relevant log files or attachments can be provided directly in the ticket once I create it for you.\n\n \ud83d\udccc Important: Your ticket will be created in one of two ways:\n\n\t* Immediately after you provide the requested information above, or\n\n\t* Automatically after 5 minutes if no response is received\n\nPlease keep this browser/chat window open until you receive your ticket number as confirmation. \n\n--- Customer (Kevin Gragert) ---\n\n what is ticket number \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n If you want to add additional \ud83d\udce7 email addresses in the ticket CC, please specify them below.\n\nYou can specify multiple email addresses, separated by a comma (for example: test@example.com, test2@example.com)\n\nOtherwise, just click the button \ud83d\udc47 \n"
