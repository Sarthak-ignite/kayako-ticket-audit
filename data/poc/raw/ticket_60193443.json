          "Kayako - ticket id 60193443 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear asim.mehmood,\n\nThank you for your continued updates and for providing detailed diagnostic information and feedback regarding your ongoing GFI LanGuard scheduled scanning issue. Based on your input, the attached reference image, and extensive troubleshooting already completed, I want to summarize the situation and provide actionable, targeted recommendations to help restore the scanning functionality across your endpoints without requiring a full redeployment of all agents.\n\nKey Findings from Diagnostics and your Description:\n\n \t* Repeated scans and schedule failures on your endpoints are directly associated with date corruption inside the <LastRecurringScan> tag in toolcfg_agent.xml files.\n \t* The previously suggested workaround has required replacing this file on problematic agents with a fresh version.\n \t* Full redeployment or mass agent reinstallations are not feasible in your enterprise banking context with over 300 endpoints, nor are they appropriate given the root cause identified.\n\nImmediate, Targeted Actions to Resolve Agent Scheduling Issues:\n\n \t* Repair Corrupted Agent Configuration Files: \nFor endpoints affected by the toolcfg_agent.xml date corruption, continue the targeted replacement of this file on those machines only. This addresses the specific recurrence issue without impacting all endpoints. \n\n\t* Re-Register Core Server Modules to Ensure Scheduling Functionality: \nIf multiple agents continue to fail scheduled scans, it\u2019s important to ensure the agentmanagercom.dll module is correctly registered on your central LanGuard server. Follow the steps below: \n\n \t* Stop all LanGuard services via services.msc.\n \t* Open an elevated Command Prompt (Run as Administrator).\n \t* Run the command:\nregsvr32 \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GFI\\LanGuard xx\\agentmanagercom.dll\"\nNote: Replace xx with your installed version number. \n \t* Restart LanGuard services and reopen the console.\n \t* Schedule a new scan and observe if the issue persists.\n\nMore detailed steps can be found at: Scheduled Scans and Patch Deployments Not Running [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122473].\n\n\t* Verify Permissions for Scanning and Communication: \nScheduled scans may fail if the required permissions are missing for service or scanning accounts. It\u2019s essential to ensure: \n\n \t* Scanning and communication accounts are included in the Replace a process level token and Logon as a batch job Windows local security policies on both server and endpoints.\n \t* Correct account assignments for scheduled scans as detailed in: Why is the Activity Monitor Not Showing Scheduled Scans and Remediation Results? [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122194]\n\n \t* Performance Optimization for Slow Agents: \nIf agents remain slow after correcting schedule files, refer to: Resolving a Slow Scanning Issue [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122502] for performance best practices. \n\nSummary of Best Practices:\n\n \t* Avoid full agent redeployment\u2014focus on targeted file replacement and server module validation as above.\n \t* If issues localize to certain machines, restrict corrective actions to those endpoints only.\n \t* If persistent failures continue, systematically re-validate configuration, permissions, and DLL registration as per outlined articles.\n\nAll instructions in this response are based on support analysis of your submitted files and knowledge base best practices for resolving enterprise-scale scheduling defects. There is no requirement for mass redeployment based on the current evidence; solutions can and should be implemented selectively to limit any disruption to your environment.\n\nIf the problem remains unresolved after these corrective actions on your affected endpoints and central server, monitoring diagnostic logs for new patterns may provide additional actionable details. Please feel free to reach out if specific error codes or behaviors continue on particular agents.\n\nFor reference and further reading:\n\n \t* Why is the Activity Monitor Not Showing Scheduled Scans and Remediation Results? [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122194]\n \t* Scheduled Scans and Patch Deployments Not Running [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122473]\n \t* Creating, Editing, and Configuring a Scheduled Scan [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/123266]\n \t* Why are few agents not scanning according to the schedule? [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/123151]\n\nPlease let us know how the outlined approaches work in your environment. We understand the urgency and remain committed to helping you achieve reliable scheduled scanning with the least disruption.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - LanGuard Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60193443 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear asim.mehmood,\n\nThank you for your detailed feedback and for sharing the reference image and diagnostic logs from your environment. I understand the critical impact this ongoing scheduled scan failure is having in your banking operations, especially with over 300 endpoints, and your concerns about proposed redeployment steps. I want to provide detailed guidance based on your situation and the technical findings so far.\n\nKey observations from your attachment:\n\n \t* The repeated scans and scheduling issues are linked to a date corruption in the <LastRecurringScan> tag within the toolcfg_agent.xml file on affected agents.\n \t* The current recommended workaround has involved replacing this XML file on problematic endpoints with a new version provided by support.\n\nUnderstanding Your Situation: You have already completed all standard troubleshooting, including log reviews, environmental checks, and communications with your partner and our support. The issue persists even after advanced troubleshooting steps advised by the development team. The request to redeploy or reinstall agents across your entire infrastructure is not practical or acceptable for your environment, particularly given the scale and business sensitivity.\n\nPlausible Root Causes Based on Our Knowledge Base:\n\n \t* Agent-side configuration corruption: Damaged or inconsistent agent configuration files may cause persistent scan scheduling errors and recurrences. In your specific case, the date corruption in toolcfg_agent.xml validates this concern.\n \t* Agent-server communication or permission issues: The scheduling subsystem can also be affected by insufficient permissions or intermittent connectivity between agents and the LanGuard server. Ensure all security permissions for scanning accounts, as referenced here: Activity Monitor Not Showing Scheduled Scans and Remediation Results [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122194].\n \t* Corruption of critical modules or DLLs on the LanGuard server: If issues are affecting multiple agents after an update, re-registering core components on the LanGuard server itself can sometimes resolve persistent issues without redeploying agents. Detailed steps for this are found here: Scheduled Scans and Patch Deployments Not Running [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122473].\n\nRecommended Actions to Avoid Full Redeployment:\n\n \t* Validate agent configuration files: Since the toolcfg_agent.xml corruption is confirmed, continue restoring this file on affected endpoints as a targeted action. This avoids broad redeployment and addresses known XML date inconsistencies directly.\n \t* Re-register server DLLs and services: On your LanGuard server, perform these steps to ensure all key modules are properly registered: \n\u2014 Stop all LanGuard services (services.msc). \n\u2014 Open an elevated command prompt and run: regsvr32 \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GFI\\LanGuard xx\\agentmanagercom.dll\" (replace xx with your LanGuard version). \n\u2014 Start all LanGuard services and reopen the console. \n\u2014 Schedule and verify a scan to check if the problem persists. \n \t* Review permissions and connectivity: Ensure scanning accounts and the LNSSCommunicator module have Replace a process level token and Logon as a batch job rights as described in: this article [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122194]. \n \t* Avoid mass uninstallation/reinstallation: There is no evidence that a full redeployment is the only solution. The above targeted remediation steps should resolve configuration-level issues for affected endpoints only. \n \t* Troubleshoot agent performance issues: If agents remain slow even after fixing schedule/corruption problems, review best practices in: Resolving a Slow Scanning Issue [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122502] for recommendations on improving performance without redeployment. \n\nIf the steps above do not resolve the issue for specific agents, continue to replace only the corrupted configuration file (toolcfg_agent.xml) or perform an agent repair on those individual machines rather than all endpoints. Monitoring logs for recurring or new error codes will further help target the exact cause without impacting your entire environment.\n\nSummary:\n- Avoid full environment redeployment; focus on targeted remediation of agent configuration or XML corruption.\n- Re-register DLLs and confirm service credentials on the LanGuard server.\n- Ensure all required permissions and network exclusions are present.\n- Refer to the linked knowledge base articles above for stepwise resolution procedures.\n\nIf new or different symptoms appear that are not covered in these recommendations, feel free to update this case with those details and relevant logs for further guidance.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - LanGuard Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.
