          "Kayako - ticket id 60100448 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear David,\n\nThank you for your follow-up and for providing the screenshot confirming the update behavior on your Kerio Control Box NG110.\n\n1) Compatibility List for NG Units with Kerio Control 9.5.0\nAs of the latest available information, there is no official compatibility list published by GFI that includes the NG110 series as supported for Kerio Control version 9.5.0 or later. The NG110 appliance is supported up to the 9.4.x branch. This is reflected in the fact that version 9.5.0 is not offered via automatic updates or visible in the Webadmin interface for this hardware model. If GFI announces any changes to hardware compatibility in the future, such updates will be published in the official Kerio Control Release Notes [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/117070-Kerio-Control-9-4-Release-Notes] and on the Kerio Control support portal [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/hc/en-us]. At this time, you should plan for the NG110 to remain on the 9.4.x branch.\n\n2) Upgrade Behavior and Patch Installation Issue\nYour screenshot confirms that the system detects and offers \"Kerio Control 9.4.5 Patch 2\" as an available update, but the upgrade process fails\u2014after attempted installation, the device remains on version 9.4.5 build 8629, and the update continues to be offered. This behavior indicates that the appliance is not successfully applying the patch, despite the update mechanism functioning and sufficient disk space being available.\n\nBased on your description and the file analysis, here are the key points and recommendations:\n\n \t* Patch File vs. Full Image: The file you manually uploaded (kerio-control-upgrade-9.4.5-8629-linux.img) is the full image for version 9.4.5 build 8629, which matches your current installed version. To upgrade to Patch 2, you must use the specific patch file for 9.4.5 Patch 2, if available for your hardware. Uploading the same version image will not trigger an upgrade or resolve the patch installation issue.\n \t* Patch Availability: If the 9.4.5 Patch 2 file is not available for download for the NG110 from the official Kerio archive, it is likely that this patch is not officially supported or released for your appliance model. This is a common scenario for hardware appliances that have reached the end of their supported upgrade path.\n \t* Upgrade Safeguards: The persistent offer of the patch and the failure to apply it, with no error messages or log entries, suggest that the appliance firmware is preventing the upgrade due to compatibility or integrity checks. This is a built-in safeguard to ensure system stability and prevent unsupported upgrades.\n \t* Log Availability: On some NG appliances, the \"system\" log may not be present or may be named differently. If no relevant errors are found in other logs and the upgrade continues to fail, this further supports the likelihood of a compatibility safeguard at work.\n\nSummary of Recommendations:\n\n \t* The NG110 is not supported for Kerio Control 9.5.0 or later, and there is no official compatibility list indicating future support for these versions on NG110 hardware.\n \t* To upgrade to 9.4.5 Patch 2, ensure you are using the correct patch file specifically for your appliance. If such a file is not available, the patch is not supported for your model.\n \t* The repeated failure to apply the patch, with no errors and sufficient disk space, indicates a firmware safeguard is preventing the upgrade\u2014this is expected behavior for unsupported or restricted updates on NG hardware.\n \t* For reference, you can review the Kerio Control 9.4 Release Notes [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/117070-Kerio-Control-9-4-Release-Notes] for details on supported versions and hardware.\n\nIf you have further questions about supported versions or require clarification on available upgrade files, please let us know. We are here to assist with any additional guidance you may need regarding your NG110 appliance.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - Kerio Control Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60100448 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear David,\n\nThank you for your follow-up questions regarding the Kerio Control Box NG110 and the upgrade process.\n\n1) Future Compatibility of NG110 with Kerio Control 9.5.0\nAs of the latest available information, the Kerio Control Box NG110 series is not supported for Kerio Control version 9.5.0 or later. This is why the 9.5.0 upgrade is not offered via automatic updates or visible in the Webadmin interface for this hardware model. There has been no official announcement from GFI regarding future support for 9.5.0 or later versions on the NG110 platform. Historically, hardware appliances like the NG110 are supported only up to specific software versions due to hardware limitations and end-of-life policies. If there are any changes to this policy in the future, they will be communicated through official Kerio Control release notes and documentation [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/hc/en-us]. At this time, you should plan for the NG110 to remain on the 9.4.x branch.\n\n2) Manual Update Attempt and Log Availability\nYou have confirmed that you attempted a manual update by uploading kerio-control-upgrade-9.4.5-8629-linux.img, but after reboot, the device remains on version 9.4.5 build 8629. You also noted that there is no \"system\" log available on the NG110, and no errors are present in other logs, with sufficient disk space available (22GB free).\n\nGiven these details, here are some important points and recommendations:\n\n \t* Firmware Version Matching: The file kerio-control-upgrade-9.4.5-8629-linux.img matches the version already installed (9.4.5 build 8629). If you are attempting to upgrade to 9.4.5 Patch 2, please ensure you are using the correct patch file (for example, kerio-control-upgrade-9.4.5-p2-linux.img or similar), as uploading the same version will not result in an upgrade.\n \t* Patch File Availability: If you do not see the patch file available for download for the NG110, it may indicate that the patch is not officially released or supported for this hardware. Always verify that the patch or upgrade file is listed as compatible with your appliance model in the Kerio Control 9.4 Release Notes [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/117070-Kerio-Control-9-4-Release-Notes] or the official download portal.\n \t* Log Files: On some hardware appliances, the \"system\" log may not be present or may be named differently. You can check the \"error\" or \"messages\" logs for any entries related to the upgrade process. If no errors are present and the upgrade does not proceed, it is likely due to a safeguard or compatibility check within the appliance firmware.\n \t* Upgrade Limitations: If the appliance consistently reverts to the same version after a manual upgrade attempt, and no errors are logged, this typically indicates that the appliance firmware is preventing the upgrade due to compatibility or integrity checks. This is a built-in safety feature to prevent unsupported or potentially harmful upgrades.\n\nSummary:\n- The NG110 is not supported for Kerio Control 9.5.0 or later, and there is no indication that this will change in the future.\n- Ensure you are using the correct patch file for any upgrade attempts. Uploading the same version will not trigger an upgrade.\n- If the correct patch file is not available for your appliance, it is likely not supported.\n- The absence of errors and the appliance reverting to the previous version indicate a compatibility safeguard.\n\nIf you have any further questions about supported versions or need clarification on available upgrade files, please refer to the Kerio Control 9.4 Release Notes [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/117070-Kerio-Control-9-4-Release-Notes] or let us know for additional guidance.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - Kerio Control Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

Compatibility of Kerio Control 9.5.0 with NG110:\nAs of the latest available information, Kerio Control Box NG110 appliances are supported up to version 9.4.x. The 9.5.0 release is not offered via automatic updates for NG110 hardware because this model is not officially supported for 9.5.0 and later versions. This is why you do not see the 9.5.0 upgrade option in the Webadmin interface. Installing unsupported versions may result in instability or hardware incompatibility.\n\n2. Failed Upgrade to 9.4.5 Patch 2:\nIf the upgrade to 9.4.5 Patch 2 fails and the device reverts to 9.4.5 build 8629 after a long reboot, this typically indicates that the appliance detected an issue during the upgrade process and automatically rolled back to the previous stable version. Since no error messages were displayed, the most common causes are:\n\n \t* Insufficient disk space on the appliance.\n \t* Corrupted upgrade file or interrupted download.\n \t* Hardware compatibility issues specific to the NG110 series.\n\nRecommended Steps:\n\n \t* Manual Upgrade Attempt: If you wish to attempt the upgrade again, you can manually download the 9.4.5 Patch 2 firmware from the official Kerio archive and upload it via the Webadmin interface. This can sometimes resolve issues caused by corrupted automatic downloads. However, since the device is remote and you require high confidence, ensure you have a backup of the configuration before proceeding.\n \t* Check Disk Space: In the Webadmin interface, review the available disk space on the appliance. If space is low, consider cleaning up old logs or backups before retrying the upgrade.\n \t* Review System Logs: After a failed upgrade, check the system logs (Status > Logs > System) for any entries related to the upgrade process. These may provide more insight into the cause of the rollback.\n\nSummary:\n- The NG110 appliance is not supported for Kerio Control 9.5.0 or later, which is why the upgrade is not offered.\n- The failed upgrade to 9.4.5 Patch 2 is likely due to a system safeguard (such as disk space or file integrity). Manual upgrade and log review are recommended for further troubleshooting.\n\nIf you need further guidance on performing a manual upgrade or interpreting log entries, please let us know. For more details on supported versions and release notes, you can refer to the Kerio Control 9.4.3 Patch 2 Release Notes [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/hc/en-us/articles/116092-Kerio-Control-9-4-3-Patch-2-Release-Notes] and related documentation.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - Kerio Control Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

It is Appliance Kerio Control Box NG110 Series (Serial: LNKR20070868). It offers only upgrade to 9.4.5 Patch 2 but attempt to upgrade failed - after restart (long time, about 10 minutes) it rebooted to 9.4.5 8629 again. And it does not offer upgrade to 9.5.0. Can you help ? \nChat Support:\n\n David Veselka , I see that you are an active GFI reseller/distributor.\nWhile not mandatory, it may be useful for troubleshooting if you provide me with the Kerio Control license key for which you are contacting us. \ud83d\ude0a.\nPlease select the option that applies below \ud83d\udc47 \nDavid Veselka:\n\n 20339-765V4-1ZD1A \nChat Support:\n\n Given your reseller/distributor status, that's alright, so let's get down to business! \ud83d\udedf \nChat Support:\n\n If you have any \ud83d\udcc3 log files or \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f screenshots to upload to help with the troubleshooting, now is the time to do it \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\u2139\ufe0f When you select to upload files, a new window will open to our secure portal allowing you to upload the attachments.\n\n\u2139\ufe0f When you are done uploading files, come back to this window to continue the flow.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Depending on the size and filetype you upload, the analysis may take some time.\n\n\u2139\ufe0f In case it doesn't automatically open, here is the direct URL for it:\n\ud83d\udc49 Secure File Upload [https://files.eswsecuretransfers.com/customers?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzZXNzaW9uX3V1aWQiOiI3MDcyNGQ2My0xODA4LTQ1NTQtYmEyMC1lZThiNzU4YTkyNzciLCJzZXNzaW9uX3VpZCI6IjcwNzI0ZDYzLTE4MDgtNDU1NC1iYTIwLWVlOGI3NThhOTI3NyIsImVtYWlsIjoidmVzZWxrYUBkdmNvbXAuY3oiLCJjdXN0b21fcGFyc2VyIjp7fSwiY2FsbGJhY2siOnsiY2FsbGJhY2tfdXJsIjpudWxsLCJjYWxsYmFja19lbWFpbCI6ImNpcHJpYW4ubmFzdGFzZUB0cmlsb2d5LmNvbSJ9LCJwcm9kdWN0X3RhZyI6ImF1cmVhX2tlcmlvX2NvbnRyb2wiLCJxdWVyeSI6IiIsImV4cCI6MTc1MjIyNDg0MH0.Pit9KU1Dag-qTI46zG7B454rIRcyxUTHz6hF1cOoyyc]\n\nYou should see the following:\n- User: veselka@dvcomp.cz\n- Session ID: 70724d63-1808-4554-ba20-ee8b758a9277 \nDavid Veselka:\n\n \ud83d\udd19 Continue without file upload \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for the details! Let me summarize to make sure I understand:\n\n- You have a Kerio Control Box NG110 (Serial: LNKR20070868) running version 9.4.5 build 8629.\n- The device only offers an upgrade to 9.4.5 Patch 2, but the upgrade fails\u2014after a long reboot, it returns to 9.4.5 build 8629.\n- It does not offer an upgrade to 9.5.0.\n\nLet's address both issues: the failed patch upgrade and the missing 9.5.0 upgrade option.\n\nTo help pinpoint the cause, could you please answer a few quick questions?\n1. Did you see any error messages during or after the failed upgrade attempt? If so, what did they say?\n2. Has this device ever been factory reset or re-imaged, or is it running the original OS install?\n3. Is the device connected to the internet directly, or is it behind another firewall/router?\n4. Has the device\u2019s license been renewed recently, or is it possibly expired?\n5. Have you tried downloading the upgrade file manually from the Kerio archive and applying it via the Webadmin interface?\n\nThese details will help me narrow down whether this is a licensing, connectivity, or hardware-specific issue.\n\nLet me know what you find, and we\u2019ll get this sorted! \nDavid Veselka:\n\n 1. No errors displayed \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for confirming\u2014no errors displayed during or after the upgrade attempt. That\u2019s helpful!\n\nA few more questions to narrow this down:\n2. Has the NG110 ever been factory reset or re-imaged, or is it still running the original OS install?\n3. Is the device connected directly to the internet, or is it behind another firewall or router?\n4. Has the device\u2019s license been renewed recently, or is there any chance it\u2019s expired?\n5. Have you tried downloading the upgrade file manually from the Kerio archive and applying it via the Webadmin interface?\n\nThese details will help me figure out if the issue is related to licensing, connectivity, or something else. Once I have this info, I can guide you with the next steps! \nDavid Veselka:\n\n 2. Original OS, only upgradede in place \nChat Support:\n\n Great, thanks for clarifying that the NG110 is still running its original OS and has only been upgraded in place\u2014no factory reset or re-image.\n\nLet\u2019s keep narrowing it down:\n\n3. Is the device connected directly to the internet, or is it behind another firewall or router?\n4. Has the device\u2019s license been renewed recently, or is there any chance it\u2019s expired?\n5. Have you tried downloading the upgrade file manually from the Kerio archive and applying it via the Webadmin interface? If yes, what happened?\n\nThese details will help me determine if the upgrade issue is due to network restrictions, licensing, or something else. Let me know, and we\u2019ll keep moving forward! \nDavid Veselka:\n\n 3. Directly connected \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for confirming that the device is directly connected to the internet. That rules out some network-related upgrade issues.\n\nJust a couple more things to check so I can give you the most accurate guidance:\n\n4. Has the device\u2019s license been renewed recently, or is there any chance it\u2019s expired?\n5. Have you tried downloading the upgrade file manually from the Kerio archive and applying it via the Webadmin interface? If so, what was the result?\n\nThese last details will help me determine if the issue is related to licensing or the upgrade process itself. Once I have this info, I\u2019ll be able to suggest the best next steps! \nDavid Veselka:\n\n 4. Licence is valid till 2025-08-21 \nChat Support:\n\n Perfect, thanks for confirming your license is valid until August 2025. That rules out licensing as the cause of the upgrade issue.\n\nLast question to help pinpoint the problem:\n5. Have you tried downloading the upgrade file manually from the Kerio archive and applying it via the Webadmin interface? If yes, what happened during or after that process?\n\nThis will help me determine if the issue is with the automatic upgrade process or something else. Let me know what you\u2019ve tried, and we\u2019ll go from there! \nDavid Veselka:\n\n 5. I did no try manual update, unit is remote and I have to be sure it will work and I am not sure if version 9.5.0 is ok for NG110 beacuse it is not offered by automatic update \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for explaining your situation\u2014especially since the unit is remote, I completely understand wanting to be cautious before attempting a manual upgrade.\n\nHere\u2019s what I found:\n\n- Kerio Control 9.5.0 is officially released and available for download. You can see the release notes here: Kerio Control 9.5.0 Release Notes [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/124668].\n- However, there\u2019s no explicit mention in the release notes about hardware compatibility for the NG110 appliance with version 9.5.0. Sometimes, if a version isn\u2019t offered via automatic update, it could be due to hardware compatibility checks, staged rollouts, or other restrictions set by the update server.\n- Previous release notes (like for 9.4.4) do mention hardware-specific support and limitations, but there\u2019s no clear statement about NG110 being unsupported for 9.5.0.\n\nGiven that:\n- If the update isn\u2019t offered automatically, it\u2019s possible that either the update is being rolled out in phases, or there may be a compatibility consideration for your specific hardware.\n- Manual upgrades on remote devices always carry some risk, especially if the update isn\u2019t being offered automatically.\n\nMy recommendation:\n- If you need to minimize risk, it\u2019s best to wait until the update is available via the automatic update channel for your NG110.\n- If you must upgrade sooner, I\u2019d suggest reaching out to Kerio/GFI support directly to confirm official compatibility of 9.5.0 with the NG110 before proceeding with a manual update.\n\nWould you like help drafting a message to support, or do you want to discuss any other options? \nDavid Veselka:\n\n I wish to GFI suport directly confirm 9.5.0 compatibilty with NG110 and correct way to upgrade. Also I wish GFI support to analyse reason for failing update to 9.4.5 Patch 2 \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for sharing your concerns about the upgrade and compatibility. \ud83d\ude0a I\u2019ll connect you with a human colleague who can assist with confirming compatibility and investigating the update issue\u2014please feel free to choose from the available options to continue. \nDavid Veselka:\n\n \ud83d\udce9 Raise a ticket \nChat Support:\n\n Please provide any other additional details we might need to investigate and resolve your issue.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 If the reported behavior affects multiple end-customers, please do let us know the impact radius of the issue.\n\nYou can use Shift+Enter if you want to continue typing in a new line.\n\nFor now, I am unable to take any file uploads, so any relevant log files or attachments can be provided directly in the ticket once I create it for you.\n\n Please note: the ticket will get created only after you provide the above requested information or after a 5-minute timeout. \nDavid Veselka:\n\n I have no additional information. \nChat Support:\n\n If you want to add additional \ud83d\udce7 email addresses in the ticket CC, please specify them below.\n\nYou can specify multiple email addresses, separated by a comma (for example: test@example.com, test2@example.com)\n\nOtherwise, just click the button \ud83d\udc47 \nDavid Veselka:\n\n No additional email addresses required in CC \nChat Support:\n\n I'm creating a ticket for you with the information you've provided.\n\nTicket subject: Kerio Control NG110 upgrade issue and compatibility check\n\nAllow me a few moments while I work on this \u23f3 \nChat Support:\n\n \ud83d\ude80 I've successfully created a ticket for you.\n\nYour ticket number is: 60100448\n\nYou can see it and update it in this link [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/conversation/view/60100448]\n\nFor a faster resolution, please be sure to include and attach to the ticket all relevant context such as screenshots, recordings, and logs.\n\nOur agents will work on it and you will receive a response in your email \ud83d\udce8: veselka@dvcomp.cz "
