          "Kayako - ticket id 60242814 // Carlos Encalada commented publicly: Dear Michael,\n\nThank you for your patience, and I apologize for the delay in providing a clear answer to your question.\n\nYes \u2014 it is possible to port your fax numbers away from FaxMaker Online to your new carrier when you transition to Zoom Phone in early summer 2026, provided that these numbers were originally ported into FaxMaker Online by your organization. Since you mentioned that these were numbers you ported in during your initial setup, they are eligible to be ported out.\n\nHOW THE PORT-OUT PROCESS WORKS\n\nPort-outs from FaxMaker Online are always initiated by your new carrier. In your case, Zoom (or their underlying carrier) will need to submit the port request to move the numbers away from FaxMaker Online.\n\nThey will require:\n\n\t*\nYour organization details\n\n\t*\nYour account information\n\n\t*\nThe same information you originally provided in your Letter of Authorization (LOA) when porting the numbers into FaxMaker Online\n\nYou can also find this information in your GFI Accounts Portal under your account profile, in case you no longer have the original LOA.\n\nOnce Zoom submits the request, the port-out process typically takes a couple of weeks to complete. Your new carrier will keep you informed throughout the process.\n\nFEES\n\nThere is no fee from GFI/FaxMaker Online to port your numbers out. Any porting-related charges\u2014if applicable\u2014would come from your new carrier, not from GFI.\n\nIf you have additional questions, you can refer to our article: Porting Fax Numbers to Another Carrier from FaxMaker Online [https://support.faxmakeronline.gfi.com/article/112151-porting-fax-numbers-to-another-carrier-from-faxmaker-online].\n\nBest regards,\nCarlos Encalada\nGFI - FaxMaker Online Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal. We will write to you again to remind you."
