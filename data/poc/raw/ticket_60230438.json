That shouldn't happen, and I want to help get this sorted out for you.</p>\n      <p>Could you tell me a bit more about what the original issue was in that ticket? This will help me understand the situation better and determine the best way to assist you - whether that's resolving the issue right here or ensuring you get properly connected with a support specialist who can reopen and address your ticket.</p>\n      <p>What was the problem you were experiencing with GFI MailEssentials?</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Mike Willard) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>The failure of the Outlook spamtag add on to resolve the path to the server</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>Thank you for clarifying that! So the Outlook SpamTag add-in is failing to resolve the path to the server - that's definitely something we need to get sorted out.</p>\n      <p>Let me ask you a few questions to better understand the situation:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <p><strong>When did this issue first start happening?</strong> Was it after an update, a server change, or did it just suddenly stop working?</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p><strong>Are all users experiencing this issue, or is it isolated to specific users or workstations?</strong></p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p><strong>What error message are you seeing exactly?</strong> Does it say something like \"Cannot connect to server\" or \"Path not found,\" or is it a different message?</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p><strong>How is your GFI MailEssentials server configured?</strong> Is it on the same network as the Outlook clients, or are users connecting remotely?</p>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>These details will help me guide you through the right troubleshooting steps to get the SpamTag add-in connecting properly again.</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Mike Willard) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>After updating to mailessentials 22.2</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>Ah, that makes sense! This is actually a known issue after upgrading to MailEssentials 22.2. The good news is that there's a documented solution for this.</p>\n      <p>Based on what I'm seeing, the SpamTag add-in can have connectivity issues after upgrading to version 22.x. Here's what needs to be done to resolve this:</p>\n      <h2>Solution Steps:</h2>\n      <p><strong>Step 1: Ensure You're on the Latest Patch</strong><br>\n      First, make sure you're running the latest MailEssentials 22.2 patch, as it includes fixes for SpamTag connectivity. You can find the upgrade instructions here: <a href=\"https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/128685\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spam Tag cannot connect after upgrading to version 22.x</a></p>\n      <p><strong>Step 2: Reinstall SpamTag on Affected Workstations</strong></p>\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>Uninstall SpamTag</strong> from Add/Remove Programs in Windows</li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Delete residual files:</strong>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Delete the folder <code>...\\\\GFI\\\\MailEssentials SpamTag\\\\</code></li>\n            <li>Browse to <code>...\\\\Users\\\\Default\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\GFI\\\\</code> and delete the GFI MailEssentials folder</li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>Temporarily disable UAC</strong> (User Access Control): Start > Control Panel > User accounts > Change User Account Control Settings > Set to Never Notify</li>\n        <li><strong>Close Outlook completely</strong> before reinstalling</li>\n        <li><strong>Reinstall SpamTag</strong> using the correct server URL</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p><strong>Step 3: Verify the Connection</strong><br>\n      After reinstallation, the SpamTag toolbar should appear in Outlook's Home ribbon, and the Spam/Not Spam buttons should be active (not greyed out).</p>\n      <p>Before we proceed - have you already applied the latest MailEssentials 22.2 patch on your server, or are you still on the initial 22.2 release?</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Mike Willard) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>I have been through all this on chat Ticket ID: #60230003, nothing suggested worked and I was supposed to be getting a ticket raised with an agent. THAT is marked as closed, it is NOT.</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>I completely understand your frustration - you've already been through all these troubleshooting steps, nothing worked, and then your ticket was closed without resolution or even getting connected to an agent. That's absolutely not acceptable, and I apologize for that experience.</p>\n      <p>Let me get this escalated properly right now.
