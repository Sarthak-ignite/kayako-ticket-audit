Essentially, it\u2019s designed to store, manage, and retrieve complex data as objects\u2014just like you use in object-oriented programming. This makes it a great fit for applications that need reliable, transactional object persistence and real-time data caching.</p>\n      <p>Think of ObjectStore as a specialized filing cabinet for your software\u2019s objects, allowing you to save and retrieve them quickly and efficiently, without having to convert them into tables or rows like in traditional relational databases.</p>\n      <p>If you\u2019d like to learn more about recent releases or features, you can check out the official documentation, such as the announcement for ObjectStore Standard 2024.2 here: <a href=\"https://objectstore-ignitetech.kayako.com/article/95837\" rel=\"nofollow\">Announcing ObjectStore Standard 2024.2 General Availability</a>.</p>\n      <p>Let me know if you want more details about how it works or what makes it unique!</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Asad Khalil) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>Ok when was it first created and when was the latest update released? When is the next release planned?</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>Here's what I found about ObjectStore's history and release timeline:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <p>ObjectStore was originally created in the late 1980s as one of the first commercial object-oriented database management systems. It has a long history of supporting complex, object-based applications.</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>The latest update is ObjectStore Standard 2025.1. You can find the release notes here: <a href=\"https://objectstore-ignitetech.kayako.com/article/128218\" rel=\"nofollow\">ObjectStore Standard 2025.1 Release Notes</a>.</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>As for the next planned release, there isn't any publicly available information or official announcement about future release dates. ObjectStore typically announces new versions through their official channels, so it's best to keep an eye on their documentation or support portal for updates.</p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>If you need details about what's new in the latest release or want to know more about the product's evolution, just let me know!</p>\n    </div><br>\n  </div>"
