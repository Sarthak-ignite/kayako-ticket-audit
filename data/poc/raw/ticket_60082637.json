I\u2019ve reviewed the automated analysis, and here\u2019s a summary of what stands out:<br><br>### Key Findings from Your Files<br><br>1. <strong>Services & Plugins Initialization</strong><br>   - All core GFI MailEssentials services and plugins (like SaveToDisk, AutoSanitize, AntispamQASC, etc.) are initializing successfully with no errors or warnings in the logs you provided.<br>   - The logs show normal startup and plugin loading, but do not capture any actual email scanning events or errors during scanning.<br><br>2. <strong>Scan Interruption</strong><br>   - There is a log entry indicating that a scheduled scan was stopped because an update became available:  <br>     > \u201cCheckSchedule >> Update is available. Scanning must be stopped!\u201d<br>   - If this happens frequently, it could prevent emails from being scanned as expected.<br><br>3. <strong>Configuration Observations</strong><br>   - EWS Info Store Protection is disabled. If you rely on this for scanning, it may need to be enabled.<br>   - Some configuration files reference non-standard installation paths (e.g., M:\\ drive). This is fine if intentional, but can cause issues if paths are incorrect or inaccessible.<br>   - No obvious misconfigurations, but a few settings (like self-signed certificates allowed, empty values for some keys) should be reviewed for security and operational impact.<br><br>4. <strong>Network & Environment</strong><br>   - No DNS is enabled on any network interface, which could cause name resolution issues for updates or external lookups.<br>   - The server is robust (Windows Server 2016, 20 CPUs, plenty of RAM), but you have 405 users\u2014make sure your license covers this.<br><br>5. <strong>No Errors in Provided Logs</strong><br>   - All logs are informational; there are no error or warning messages during the periods captured.<br>   - Some logs are incomplete (headers only), so I can\u2019t see the full picture for Exchange or SQL integration.<br><br><hr><br><br>### Recommendations & Next Steps<br><br>1. <strong>Check for Scan Interruptions</strong><br>   - Are you seeing frequent \u201cscan stopped due to update\u201d messages? If so, try scheduling updates and scans so they don\u2019t overlap.<br><br>2. <strong>Enable EWS Info Store Protection (if needed)</strong><br>   - If you expect mailbox-level scanning, ensure this feature is enabled in your configuration.<br><br>3. <strong>Verify Network/DNS</strong><br>   - Enable DNS on at least one network interface to ensure proper name resolution for updates and external services.<br><br>4. <strong>Review Licensing</strong><br>   - Double-check that your license covers all 405 users.<br><br>5. <strong>Check for Errors During Actual Email Flow</strong><br>   - The logs you provided don\u2019t show any scanning events or errors during email processing. Could you provide logs captured during a time when emails should have been scanned? Specifically, look for error or warning entries.<br><br>6. <strong>Confirm Plugin & Path Configuration</strong><br>   - Make sure all plugin DLLs are present in the specified paths and that the M:\\ drive is always available.<br><br>7. <strong>Security Settings</strong><br>   - Review the use of self-signed certificates and other security-related settings for compliance with your organization\u2019s policies.<br><br><hr><br><br>#### Could you clarify a few things to help us narrow this down?<br>- Are you seeing any error messages in the GFI MailEssentials dashboard or Windows Event Viewer?<br>- Is the issue affecting all emails, or only certain types (e.g., internal vs. external)?<br>- Has anything changed recently in your environment (Exchange updates, network changes, etc.)?<br><br>If you can provide logs from the time when emails should have been scanned (with error/warning entries if possible), that would be very helpful!<br><br>Let me know, and we\u2019ll keep digging until we get this sorted out."
