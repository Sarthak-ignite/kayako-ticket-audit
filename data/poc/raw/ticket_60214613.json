So if a customer doesnt get the admin options, you just need to add his email in this sheet (which is not the issue here, since he got the admin menu (as per the other ticket linked here, correct COID is 104983). \n\n\t* To get count of active licenses , bot searches 2 places:\u00a0 \n\n \t* Salesforce using the 2 fields shared on the ticket (this requires no onboarding effort from CS, should be done by BU),\nexample from another customer:\nimage\n\n \t* then 2checkout, using a mapping Dynamo DB table (this requires onboarding effort for FFM or new companies, you can contact me for more details).\n\n \t* To get count of active devices, we use the same mapping Dynamo DB table (this requires onboarding effort for FFM or new companies). From that mapping table, Chatbot API gets the creds of an API user which has access to check active devices count, and add devices.\n\n So based on the errors in the ticket, we have 2 issues here: \n1. SF is not populated with the 2 fields mentioned, we need to ask BU to populate it.\nhttps://trilogy-sales.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Account/0012x00000A4hSzAAJ/view\nimage \n 2. This companyID is not onboarded on Dynamo DB. You can let me know if you need to add one or more company IDs which need to be onboarded, and I can onboard them, preferably in bulk. \n\n Note that we requested the same from BU side many times before, last time was 24th Sep, in a mail thread with saurish.savant@ignitetech.com. \n\n Will get back to requester, hoping he could help with the task from BU side .
