Yes, there are definitely faster ways to delete users in bulk rather than going through the web admin interface one by one. Let me get you the best information on this.\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      Based on the knowledge base, I can see information about deleting users through the web interface, but let me check if there are any API or command-line options available for bulk operations:\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      Perfect! Yes, there are actually <strong>faster alternatives</strong> to deleting users through the web interface:<br>\n      <br>\n      <h2><strong>Option 1: Using the Kerio Connect API</strong> \u2728</h2><br>\n      <br>\n      Kerio Connect offers APIs that allow you to automate user management tasks, including bulk user deletion. You can use the <strong>Administration API</strong> to programmatically remove multiple users through scripting.<br>\n      <br>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Administration API documentation</strong>: <a href=\"https://manuals.gfi.com/en/kerio/api/connect/admin/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Administration API for Kerio Connect</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Client API documentation</strong>: <a href=\"https://manuals.gfi.com/en/kerio/api/connect/client/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Client API for Kerio Connect</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Developer resources</strong>: Check out the <a href=\"http://www.kerio.com/developers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kerio Developer Zone</a> for client libraries and sample code\n        </li>\n      </ul><br>\n      <br>\n      You can write a script (for example, in PHP or Python) that connects to the API and loops through a list of users to delete them in bulk. This is much faster than clicking through the web interface for each user.<br>\n      <br>\n      For more details, see: <a href=\"https://support.kerioconnect.gfi.com/article/112058\" rel=\"nofollow\">Using Kerio Connect API</a>\n      <hr>\n      <h2><strong>Option 2: Multi-Select in Web Interface</strong></h2><br>\n      <br>\n      While not as automated as the API approach, you can select <strong>multiple users at once</strong> in the web admin interface:<br>\n      <br>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Log in to the Kerio Connect administration console</li>\n        <li>Navigate to <strong>Accounts > Users</strong></li>\n        <li>Hold <strong>Ctrl</strong> (Windows/Linux) or <strong>Cmd</strong> (Mac) and click to select multiple users</li>\n        <li>Click <strong>Remove</strong> to delete them all at once</li>\n      </ol><br>\n      <br>\n      This is faster than deleting one by one, though still manual.\n      <hr>\n      <strong>Which approach sounds better for your situation?</strong> Are you looking to delete a large number of users regularly (where API scripting would be ideal), or is this a one-time cleanup where multi-select might be sufficient?\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Kjell Skoglund) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      I\u00b4ll go for thr multiple in the webinterface\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      Perfect! That's definitely the quickest manual approach. \ud83d\udc4d<br>\n      <br>\n      Just to make sure you have all the steps clear:<br>\n      <br>\n      <h2><strong>Deleting Multiple Users in the Web Interface:</strong></h2><br>\n      <br>\n      <ol>\n        <li><strong>Log in</strong> to the Kerio Connect administration console</li>\n        <li>Navigate to <strong>Accounts > Users</strong></li>\n        <li><strong>Select your domain</strong> from the dropdown (if you have multiple domains)</li>\n        <li>Hold down <strong>Ctrl</strong> (on Windows/Linux) or <strong>Cmd</strong> (on Mac) while clicking each user you want to delete</li>\n        <li>Once you've selected all the users, click the <strong>Remove</strong> button</li>\n        <li>You'll get a confirmation window with options for what to do with the user's data</li>\n      </ol><br>\n      <br>\n      <strong>Important note:</strong> When you delete users, you'll be prompted to choose what happens to their messages and data, so just make sure you select the appropriate option based on your needs.\n      <hr>\n      Is there anything else you'd like help with regarding user management in Kerio Connect, or does this cover what you needed? \ud83d\ude0a\n    </div><br>\n  </div>"
