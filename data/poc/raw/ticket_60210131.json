Just to clarify, did you receive an email saying that your FogBugz billing or payment hasn't been received, or is there an issue with an invoice or payment method on your account?\n\nTo help you further, could you provide a bit more detail:\n\n \t* Are you seeing any error messages or payment failure notifications?\n \t* Is this about a specific invoice or your overall subscription?\n \t* Have you recently updated your payment method or credit card?\n\nIn the meantime, here are a couple of helpful articles that might address your situation:\n\n \t* Billing Statements and Invoices [https://support.fogbugz.com/article/54074] \n \t* Unable to Make Payment with Credit Card for FogBugz Renewal [https://support.fogbugz.com/article/53281] \n\nIf your payment is failing, sometimes banks block transactions for various reasons (like location, fraud rules, or insufficient funds). It\u2019s a good idea to check with your bank to see if they\u2019re blocking the payment to FogBugz (the merchant is Braintree). If you\u2019ve already done that and the issue persists for more than a couple of days, let me know and I can guide you on the next steps!\n\nCould you share a bit more about what you\u2019re seeing or what the email said? That\u2019ll help me point you in the right direction. \n\n--- Customer (Cedric Dubie) ---\n\n receive an email saying that your FogBugz billing hasn't been received \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for clarifying! If you received an email saying your FogBugz billing hasn't been received, it usually means there was an issue processing your payment for your subscription.\n\nHere are some common reasons this can happen (from the article Unable to Make Payment with Credit Card for FogBugz Renewal [https://support.fogbugz.com/article/53281]):\n\n \t* Incorrect credit card number or expiration date\n \t* Insufficient funds\n \t* The bank declined the transaction based on location or fraud rules\n \t* The bank is blocking the merchant (Braintree, which processes FogBugz payments)\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do next:\n\n \t* Check your payment method: Make sure your credit card details are up to date in your FogBugz account.\n \t* Contact your bank: Ask if they are blocking payments to Braintree or if there are any restrictions on your card.\n \t* Wait a bit: Sometimes, after resolving an issue with your bank, it can take a couple of days for the payment to go through.\n \t* Check for error messages: If you see any specific error messages in your account or in the email, let me know what they say.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already checked these and the payment still isn\u2019t going through after a few days, I can help escalate this to our billing team for further assistance.\n\nCould you let me know:\n\n \t* Have you recently updated your payment method?\n \t* Did your bank confirm if there\u2019s a block or issue?\n \t* Is this about a specific invoice or your overall subscription?\n\nOnce I have a bit more detail, I can guide you on the best next steps! \n\n--- Customer (Cedric Dubie) ---\n\n need to get in touch with sales or finance to validate \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Got it! If you need to get in touch with our sales or finance team to validate your billing or payment status, I can help guide you on the best way to do that.\n\nBefore I connect you, could you please provide a bit more information? This will help our finance team assist you faster:\n\n \t* Your FogBugz account email or Account ID (if available)\n \t* The company name on the account\n \t* Any invoice or order number related to the billing issue\n \t* A brief description of what you need to validate (for example, confirming payment receipt, updating billing info, etc.)\n\nOnce you provide these details, I\u2019ll make sure your request is routed to the right team for follow-up. If you prefer, I can also arrange for a support agent to reach out to you directly\u2014just let me know! \n\n--- Customer (Cedric Dubie) ---\n\n email : cedric.dubie@panorama9.com\nCompany: Panorama9 Inc.\nInvoice: INV-137033167-20250913\nconfirming payment \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for providing the details!
