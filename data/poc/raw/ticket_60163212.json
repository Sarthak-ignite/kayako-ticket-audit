Have you (or the user) already tried any troubleshooting steps, such as clearing the Outlook cache, reinstalling the Outlook Connector, or updating Outlook?<br>3.

I did upload a screen shot of the error. Yes the error message is listed.<br><br><b>Chat Support:</b><br>Thank you for the details and for uploading the screenshot. I\u2019ve reviewed the analysis, and here\u2019s what I found:<br><br>- The error message is:  <br>  Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManagerServerErrorException  <br>  It specifically mentions an issue with RadScriptBlock1 and invalid characters outside of script tags.<br><br>This type of script error is usually related to a problem in the Outlook Connector\u2019s interaction with the web components, and it can sometimes be triggered by a corrupted local cache, a problematic email item, or a temporary glitch in the Outlook Connector\u2019s files.<br><br>Here\u2019s what I recommend as next steps:<br><br>1. <strong>Clear the Outlook Connector Cache for the Affected User</strong><br>   - Close Outlook completely.<br>   - Navigate to:  <br>     `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\GFI\\MailArchiver\\`<br>   - Delete the contents of this folder (this will force the Outlook Connector to rebuild its cache).<br>   - Reopen Outlook and try restoring the email again.<br><br>2. <strong>Check for Problematic Emails</strong><br>   - If the error only happens with certain emails, there may be a corruption or unsupported content in those specific messages. Try restoring a different email to see if the error persists.<br><br>3. <strong>Review Server Logs</strong><br>   - If the above steps don\u2019t resolve the issue, it may be helpful to review the server logs for more details. You can find guidance on gathering logs here:  <br>     <a href=\"https://gfi-archiver-supportdesk.kayako.com/article/106126-gathering-troubleshooter-logs-for-archiver\" target=\"_blank\">Gathering Troubleshooter Logs for Archiver</a><br><br>4. <strong>Related Knowledge Base Article</strong><br>   - While not an exact match, this article discusses a similar scenario where script errors or HTTP 500 errors occur due to issues in the database or with specific tags:  <br>     <a href=\"https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/105583\" target=\"_blank\">Error: 'GFI MailArchiver Archive Store \"2011 Jan - Dec\" is inaccessible. HTTP Error 500 - Server Error' when Outlook Connector syncs due to empty tagValue rows in arc_tags table</a><br><br>If you try these steps, could you let me know what happens? If the issue continues, please let me know if it affects all emails or just specific ones, and if possible, gather the logs as described above. That will help us dig deeper!<br><br>Is there anything else about this issue or the Outlook Connector that I can help with right now?<br><br><b>Daniel Riek:</b><br>I can upload the support log<br><br><b>Chat Support:</b><br>That would be really helpful! Please go ahead and upload the support log file. Once it's uploaded, let me know, and I'll check the analysis for any clues related to the script error and restoration issue.<br><br>Just a quick note: depending on the size of the log file, the analysis might take a little while. I can't proactively monitor the progress, so feel free to ask me for updates at any time.<br><br>Whenever you're ready, upload the log and I'll guide you through the next steps!<br><br><b>Daniel Riek:</b><br>how can i upload the support file?<br><br><b>Chat Support:</b><br>Great question! To upload your support log file for analysis, you'll need to use the external portal provided by GFI Archiver Support. Here\u2019s how you can do it:<br><br>1. <strong>Locate the Support Portal Link:</strong>  <br>   Usually, your support representative or the GFI Archiver support website will provide a secure upload link or portal for file submissions.

Actually, you\u2019re right\u2014there isn\u2019t a direct upload option within this AI chat interface itself. File uploads for analysis are handled through the external GFI Support Portal or via a secure upload link provided by the support team.<br><br>Here\u2019s what you can do:<br><br>1. <strong>If you have an open support ticket:</strong>  <br>   - Log in to your GFI Support Portal account.<br>   - Open your ticket and look for an \u201cAttach File\u201d or \u201cUpload\u201d button\u2014this is usually available on the ticket page.<br>   - Upload your support log file there.<br><br>2. <strong>If you don\u2019t have a ticket yet:</strong>  <br>   - You can create a new support ticket through the GFI Support Portal: <a href=\"https://support.gfi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GFI Support Portal</a><br>   - Once your ticket is created, you\u2019ll be able to upload files directly to it.<br><br>3. <strong>If you need a secure upload link:</strong>  <br>   - Let me know, and I can guide you on how to request one from the support team.<br><br>If you\u2019d like, I can help you with the wording to request a file upload link or walk you through the process of opening a ticket. Just let me know what works best for you!<br><br>Is there anything else I can clarify or help with regarding the upload process?<br><br><b>Daniel Riek:</b><br>where do i go to create a support ticket?<br><br><b>Chat Support:</b><br>You can create a support ticket for GFI Archiver by visiting the official GFI Support Portal. Here\u2019s how you can do it:<br><br>1. <strong>Go to the GFI Support Portal:</strong>  <br>   <a href=\"https://support.gfi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GFI Support Portal</a><br><br>2. <strong>Sign In or Register:</strong>  <br>   - If you already have an account, sign in with your credentials.<br>   - If you don\u2019t have an account yet, you\u2019ll need to register for one. Just click on the \u201cSign Up\u201d or \u201cRegister\u201d link and follow the prompts.<br><br>3. <strong>Create a New Ticket:</strong>  <br>   - Once you\u2019re logged in, look for an option like \u201cSubmit a Ticket,\u201d \u201cOpen a New Ticket,\u201d or \u201cCreate Case.\u201d<br>   - Fill in the required details about your issue.

Sometimes, the GFI Support Portal may restrict ticket creation based on your account type, support contract status, or if you\u2019re accessing as a trial user or through a partner/reseller.<br><br>Here are a few things you can try:<br><br>### 1. <strong>Check Your Login Status</strong><br>- Make sure you\u2019re logged in with the correct account. Some features (like ticket creation) are only available to registered users with an active support contract.<br><br>### 2. <strong>Look for \u201cContact Support\u201d or \u201cSubmit a Request\u201d</strong><br>- Sometimes the option is labeled as \u201cContact Support,\u201d \u201cSubmit a Request,\u201d or \u201cOpen Case\u201d instead of \u201cCreate Ticket.\u201d<br>- It might be in the top menu, sidebar, or under your account/profile dropdown.<br><br>### 3. <strong>If You Purchased Through a Reseller/Partner</strong><br>- If your GFI Archiver license was purchased through a reseller or partner, you may need to contact them directly for support or to escalate issues.<br><br>### 4. <strong>Alternative: Email Support</strong><br>- If you can\u2019t find any way to create a ticket, you can email GFI Support directly at:  <br>  <strong>support@gfi.com</strong><br>- In your email, include:<br>  - Your company name and license details (if available)<br>  - A description of your issue<br>  - Mention that you need to upload a support log file<br><br>### 5. <strong>Live Chat or Contact Form</strong><br>- Some regions or account types have access to a live chat or web contact form on the <a href=\"https://www.gfi.com/contact-us\" target=\"_blank\">GFI Contact Page</a>.<br><br><hr><br><br>If none of these options work, please let me know:<br>- How you purchased GFI Archiver (direct, reseller, partner, etc.)<br>- If you\u2019re using a trial or full license<br>- What you see when you log in to the portal (any options or error messages)<br><br>I\u2019ll do my best to guide you based on your specific situation!"
