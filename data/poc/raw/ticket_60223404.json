          "Kayako - ticket id 60223404 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Tyron,\n\nThank you for providing clear details and a screenshot regarding the intermittent 500 Internal Server Error messages encountered when using filters in your FogBugz On-Demand environment. Based on your description and the attached image, this issue is occurring for all users and only during filter operations.\n\nAccording to our knowledge base article on FogBugz On-Demand performance issues [https://support.fogbugz.com/article/53690], this type of error generally indicates a temporary issue on the server side or a problem processing particular filter queries. Here are some steps and key diagnostic insights you may find useful:\n\n1. Check for Known Outages or Maintenance\nBefore investigating further, visit the FogBugz Status Page [https://status.fogbugz.com] to make sure there are no ongoing incidents or maintenance activities that could impact filtering or server performance.\n\n2. Immediate Steps to Try\n- Clear your browser cache and cookies, then test filtering again.\n- Try accessing the filters from another browser or device to rule out local browser-related issues.\n- If your instance has a large volume of case attachments (e.g., many images or large files), filters may experience performance degradation. Open a filter with minimal results or create a new basic filter to see if the issue persists.\n\n3. Issue Scope and Nature\nYour screenshot and notes confirm that:\n- The 500 errors are occurring specifically when attempting to filter support cases.\n- All users are affected.\n- The issue started within the past 30 minutes.\nThis supports the likelihood of a temporary backend or database processing issue with filtering functionality.\n\n4. Additional Troubleshooting and Information\n- Ensure your internet connection does not have intermittent drops or bandwidth issues, as this can impact connectivity to the cloud service.\n- If possible, conduct a basic test by disabling any browser extensions that may modify loaded pages or requests.\nFor more troubleshooting steps, please refer to the article FogBugz On-Demand Slow, Non-Responsive, Unavailable, Offline, or Down [https://support.fogbugz.com/article/53690].\n\n5. Interpreting Error Messages\nThe error message \u201cThere was a problem with your search string! 500 Internal Error\u201d indicates a server-side processing issue with your filter parameters. If there are specific filters that trigger the error, try simplifying or adjusting parameters to identify if a certain field or value is the cause.\n\nIf the issue resolves itself after a brief period, it is likely related to a temporary backend processing issue. If it persists and none of the above steps help, monitor the status page [https://status.fogbugz.com] for related updates. For reference, all key diagnostic details and your screenshot confirm that the error is specific to filtering actions and not due to account inactivity or wiki configuration, as described in this article [https://support.fogbugz.com/article/53292].\n\nIf you have further technical details or additional screenshots that highlight new error messages or patterns, feel free to add them for further analysis.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nFogBugz Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

We will write to you again to remind you."

I can see you're experiencing intermittent 500 Internal Server Errors with FogBugz. That's definitely frustrating, and I'm here to help get to the bottom of this. \ud83d\udd0d\n\nLet me ask you a few questions to better understand what's happening:\n\n \t* When did you first start noticing these 500 errors? Was it recent, or has this been happening for a while?\n\n \t* What specific actions are you performing when the error occurs? For example:\n\n- Are you trying to access a specific feature (like Wikis, generating reports, viewing cases)?\n- Does it happen during login, or while you're already logged in?\n- Is it happening across the entire FogBugz instance or just in certain areas?\n\n \t* Is this affecting all users or just specific users? If it's specific users, can you let me know which ones?\n\n \t* Are you seeing any specific error messages along with the 500 error, or is it just a generic Internal Server Error page?\n\n \t* Are you using FogBugz On-Demand (cloud-hosted) or On-Premise?\n\nThe more details you can share, the better I can pinpoint what's causing these intermittent errors! \ud83d\udcaa \n\n--- Customer (Tyron) ---\n\n 1. Last 30 min\n\n \t* Filtering\n \t* all users\n \t* no\n \t* on demand\n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thank you for those details, Tyron! So this just started in the last 30 minutes, it's affecting all users when they try to use filters, and you're on FogBugz On-Demand. That's really helpful information.\n\nSince this is affecting all users and started very recently, this sounds like it could be a service-level issue with your FogBugz On-Demand instance. Given that it's impacting everyone and specifically happening during filtering operations, this is something that needs immediate attention from our support team.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n\nThis qualifies as an urgent issue since it's preventing all users from using a core feature (filtering). I'd like to escalate this to our live support team right away so they can:\n\n \t* Check the health and status of your specific FogBugz On-Demand instance\n \t* Review server logs to identify what's causing the 500 errors during filtering\n \t* Take immediate action to resolve the issue\n\nBefore I connect you with the support team, can you provide me with:\n\n \t* Your FogBugz On-Demand URL (e.g., yourcompany.fogbugz.com)\n \t* Which specific filters are causing the error? (e.g., built-in filters, custom filters, or all filters?)\n \t* Does the error happen immediately when you try to apply a filter, or does it load for a bit first?\n\nThis information will help the support team jump right into investigating your issue! \ud83d\ude80 \n\n--- Customer (Tyron) ---\n\n log a ticket with an agent this is not my responsibility to do \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n You're absolutely right, Tyron\u2014I apologize for asking too many questions. Let me get you connected with our support team right away so they can investigate this urgent issue affecting all your users. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I understand your concern, Tyron.
