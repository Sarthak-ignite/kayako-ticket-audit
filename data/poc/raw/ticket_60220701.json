          "Kayako - ticket id 60220701 // Syed Haider commented publicly: Dear Eshwar,\n\nThank you for joining me on the call today, and I sincerely apologize for the delayed response on this ticket.\n\nDuring our session, we observed that the appliance was running slowly, and on reviewing the Status page, we noted a disk usage warning. To address this, we performed the following actions:\n\n\t*\nCleared excess snapshots and logs to free up disk space.\n\n\t*\nUpdated log rotation settings to retain only two log files instead of the default higher number.\n\n\t*\nReduced the disk usage threshold for logs under the /var partition.\n\nAfter applying these configuration changes and deleting the unnecessary log files, we observed a significant improvement in appliance performance, resolving the lag that was present earlier. We also noted that the system health warning disappeared.\n\nimage\n\nUpon inspecting your disk partitions, we noted that the log partition had very limited space available, while other partitions had unused disk space. I recommended resizing the log partition to a larger size. You can follow these instructions as referenced from https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/121027-edge-cache-crash-not-enough-disk-space:\u00a0\n\n\t* \nGo to Configuration > System > Setup > Storage.\n\t* \nFind an underused partition.\n\t* \nRemove the encryption on the partition and put the appliance into Bypass mode [https://192.168.206.189/admin/launch?script=rh&template=sys-network&tabsel=nics].\n\t* \nChange the size of the partition to a value that is greater than the 'Used' value, but reduce the size by a good amount, and click on \"Resize\".\n\t* \nAfter the status of the partition changes back to \"Available\" you should be able to see how much space was removed from the partition to show up in 'unallocated storage'.\n\t* \nChange the size of the logs partition adding that unallocated storage space, click on \"Resize\" and wait.\n\t* \nIt is recommended to wait at least 5 minutes for the graphs to show up. If the graphs are not back, we recommend a reboot of the Exinda appliance.\n\n-------------------------\n\nRegarding the slowness issue you experienced (which is currently no longer occurring):\n\nIf this problem reappears, please raise a new ticket and include a system dump from your appliance, along with relevant context. We are eager to investigate any version-related performance issues. Having the system dump will allow us to engage our development team effectively with concrete evidence.\n\n-------------------------\n\nOnce again, I apologize for the delay in our initial response. I have flagged this for our management team to ensure you receive faster support in the future. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and helps us improve.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\nSyed Haider\nGFI - Exinda Network Orchestrator Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal. We will write to you again to remind you."

Let\u2019s get this sorted out!\n\nTo help pinpoint the cause, could you tell me a bit more about what you\u2019re seeing? For example:\n\n \t* Is the device running slow overall, or are specific features (like reporting, traffic shaping, or the web UI) affected?\n \t* Have you noticed high CPU or memory usage, or any error messages?\n \t* When did the performance issue start, and has anything changed in your network or configuration recently?\n\nOnce I have a bit more detail, I can guide you through some targeted troubleshooting steps. \n\n--- Customer (Eswaramoorthy P) ---\n\n Exinda Network Orchestrator Performance Issue and the disk space is full. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for sharing those details! When the disk space is full on Exinda Network Orchestrator, it can definitely cause performance issues, prevent upgrades, and even make monitoring data unavailable. Here\u2019s what you can do to resolve this:\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP: FREE UP DISK SPACE\n\n \t* Delete Unnecessary Files via Web UI\n\n- Go to Configuration > Diagnostics > Diagnostics.\n- In the Diagnostic Files table, select all files you don\u2019t need (like old sysdumps).\n- Click \u201cRemove Files.\u201d\n- Repeat for the System Snapshot Files and TCP Dump Files tables.\n- Also check Configuration > Diagnostics > TCP Dump for any old TCP dump files to remove.\n- For more details, see: 'No policy' Shown in Real-Time Monitoring and Optimizer Not Capturing Traffic [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/119390]\n\n \t* Check Which Partition is Full\n\n- If you\u2019re comfortable with the CLI, log in via SSH and run:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0df\u00a0-h\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- This will show which partition (often /var) is full.\n- For more info on diagnosing and solving disk space issues, check: Exinda - System Disk Full alert or not enough disk space available [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/121300]\n\n \t* Format the Full Partition (if needed)\n\n- Go to System > Setup > Storage in the Web UI.\n- Format the partition that\u2019s full (only if you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t need the data).\n- If you can\u2019t find the partition under warning, or if you\u2019re unsure, please contact Exinda support.\n- More details here: Disk Usage High [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/117230]\n\n \t* Restart the Optimizer or Reboot\n\n- After clearing space, restart the optimizer.\n- If issues persist, try rebooting the Exinda: Configuration > Maintenance > Reboot / Shutdown. \n-------------------------\n If you follow these steps and the disk is still full or the system remains slow, let me know! I can guide you through more advanced troubleshooting or help you get in touch with a live support agent if needed.\n\nWould you like to start with the Web UI cleanup, or do you need help with the CLI commands? \n\n--- Customer (Eswaramoorthy P) ---\n\n all these action were done.
