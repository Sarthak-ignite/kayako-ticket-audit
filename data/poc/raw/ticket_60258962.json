          "Kayako - ticket id 60258962 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Robert,\n\nThank you for providing such a detailed description of your situation and attaching your diagnostic file. Your summary confirms:\n\n \t* All cumulative updates (CUs) for Windows 11 24H2 are consistently failing to deploy via GFI LanGuard, producing error 552: The passed ACL did not contain the minimum required information.\n \t* Other Microsoft and 3rd party updates install correctly via LanGuard on the same machines.\n \t* You can install the cumulative updates manually on any affected computer, ruling out a fundamental Windows or credential problem.\n\nRoot Cause and Scope\n\nGiven that:\n\n \t* The same credentials and permissions succeed with other updates;\n \t* CUs have not been deploying via LanGuard for months on any machine, but install fine manually;\n\nThis behavior aligns with known compatibility and deployment method limitations specific to how cumulative updates for Windows 11 24H2 are handled by GFI LanGuard's standard remediation process. This is not a general permissions issue, but a technical challenge related strictly to cumulative update delivery on this OS version.\n\nWorkaround: Custom Software Deployment for Cumulative Updates\n\nTo reliably deploy these updates to all affected systems without manual local installs, please use GFI LanGuard\u2019s Custom Software Deployment feature. This enables you to push out .msu update files in a way that bypasses the limitations of the standard patching flow.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n \t* Download the cumulative update (.msu file) from the Microsoft Update Catalog [https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/].\n \t* Create a batch file (e.g., install_update.bat) in the same folder as the .msu file, using this command:\nwusa.exe KBxxxxxxx.msu /quiet /norestart\n(Replace KBxxxxxxx.msu with your file's actual name.) \n \t* In the GFI LanGuard console, select the Remediate tab, then go to Remediation Center.\n \t* Select your target computers, then click Deploy Custom Software.\n \t* Click Add and select your batch file; then click Add again, select the .msu file, and ensure Auxiliary file is checked.\n \t* Begin deployment and monitor the results within LanGuard.\n\nA fully detailed walkthrough, complete with screenshots, is available in our knowledge base here: Template to push out common Windows updates like Cumulative Updates via LanGuard's Custom Software Deployment feature [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122594].\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\t* If you encounter new issues related to permissions or authentication, these articles may help with more in-depth troubleshooting: \n\n \t* Error: 'Failed: Access Denied' under Progress Details when attempting to perform a patch deployment [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122680]\n \t* Resolving 'Access Denied' Error for LanGuard Scanning, Remediation, and Agent Installation [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/123087]\n\nSummary\n\nBy using the Custom Software Deployment workflow in GFI LanGuard, you can centrally and efficiently deploy cumulative updates to all of your Windows 11 24H2 endpoints, eliminating the need for local manual installation on each of your 80+ machines. This is the best practice until native compatibility is expanded in future product updates.\n\nIf\u202fyou have any follow-up questions or encounter a different error with the custom deployment process, don\u2019t hesitate to provide the details. I\u2019ll be happy to review your findings and help you refine your deployment approach.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - LanGuard Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60258962 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Robert,\n\nThank you for providing detailed information about your issue with cumulative Windows 11 updates failing to deploy via GFI LanGuard, with error 552: The passed ACL did not contain the minimum required information. I appreciate the additional context confirming that:\n\n \t* You are able to install these cumulative updates manually on target machines.\n \t* Other Windows patches deploy successfully through LanGuard using the same credentials.\n \t* This issue affects all cumulative updates for Windows 11 24H2 over the past several months.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nSince manual installation works and the same credentials are successful for other patch types, this suggests the problem is specific to how LanGuard deploys cumulative updates on Windows 11 24H2. This is a known challenge when certain patches or target OS versions have compatibility quirks with patch deployment software.\n\nImmediate Workaround: Use Custom Software Deployment\n\nYou can successfully deploy these cumulative updates by leveraging LanGuard's Custom Software Deployment feature, which provides an alternative to the standard patching flow. This workaround is recommended in our knowledge base and allows for the manual deployment method to be automated across multiple devices.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n \t* Download the required cumulative update (.msu file) from the Microsoft Update Catalog [https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/].\n \t* Create a batch file (e.g., install_update.bat) with the following command (replace KBxxxxxxx.msu with your downloaded update name):\nwusa.exe KBxxxxxxx.msu /quiet /norestart\n \t* In the GFI LanGuard console, go to the Remediate tab > Remediation Center.\n \t* Select the computers to deploy to and click Deploy Custom Software.\n \t* Click Add to include your batch file, then Add again to include the .msu file (ensure Auxiliary file is checked).\n \t* Deploy as instructed and monitor the deployment results.\n\nYou may find detailed illustrated instructions and examples in our knowledge base article: Template to push out common Windows updates like Cumulative Updates via LanGuard's Custom Software Deployment feature [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122594].\n\nAdditional Troubleshooting References\n\n \t* If you suspect any lingering permissions or group policy issues, you may also review: Error: 'Failed: Access Denied' under Progress Details when attempting to perform a patch deployment [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122680]\n \t* For other authentication or ACL-related problems, review: Resolving 'Access Denied' Error for LanGuard Scanning, Remediation, and Agent Installation [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/123087]\n\nSummary\n\nYour best path forward is to utilize the custom deployment method outlined above for cumulative updates until a compatibility update or further guidance is provided for standard cumulative patch deployment on Windows 11 24H2 through LanGuard.\n\nIf you have any additional observations from your deployment attempts or run into further technical challenges, feel free to share the outcomes and we can assist in fine-tuning the approach.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - LanGuard Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

I can see the issue clearly - you're getting the error The passed ACL did not contain the minimum required information (552) when trying to deploy the cumulative update for Windows 11 Version 24H2 (KB5066861).\n\nThis error is related to Access Control List (ACL) permissions, which means the update process doesn't have the necessary permissions or information to proceed. Let me help you troubleshoot this.\n\nFIRST, LET&#39;S CHECK A FEW THINGS:\n\n1. Are you deploying these updates through GFI LanGuard's remediation feature, or is this happening during a Windows Update scan?\n\nWhile I look into this specific error 552, I found some related permission issues in our knowledge base. The most common cause for deployment failures with Access Denied type errors is typically related to:\n\n \t* The account used by the GFI LanGuard Attendant Service not having proper rights to the target computers\n \t* Domain policies limiting the rights of the LANGUARD_XX_USER account\n \t* Issues with user impersonation during the deployment process\n\nYou can find more details here: Error: 'Failed: Access Denied' under Progress Details when attempting to perform a patch deployment [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122680]\n\nCould you tell me a bit more about your setup? Specifically:\n\n \t* Are you using domain credentials for the GFI LanGuard Attendant Service?\n \t* Have there been any recent changes to group policies in your environment?\n\n--- Customer (Robert Murray) ---\n\n domain credentials \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Perfect, thanks for confirming you're using domain credentials. Based on the error 552 you're seeing and the fact that you're using domain credentials, this is very likely a permissions and group policy issue affecting the deployment process.\n\nThe error The passed ACL did not contain the minimum required information typically occurs when there are group policies preventing the local LANGUARD_XX_USER account from properly impersonating the domain account used by the GFI LanGuard Attendant Service.\n\nHERE&#39;S WHAT WE NEED TO CHECK AND FIX:\n\nSTEP 1: VERIFY THE GFI LANGUARD ATTENDANT SERVICE CONFIGURATION\n\nOn your LanGuard server:\n\n \t* Go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services\n \t* Find GFI LanGuard XX Attendant Service and verify:\n\n- It's running\n- It's using your domain account (in format <Domain><User>)\n- The domain account has local administrator rights on all target machines\n\nSTEP 2: CONFIGURE DCOM IDENTITY\n\nStill on the LanGuard server:\n\n \t* Press Windows + R, type dcomcnfg and press Enter\n \t* Expand Component Services > Computers > My Computer > DCOM Config\n \t* Find LNSSCommunicator, right-click and open Properties\n \t* Go to the Identity tab\n \t* Select the domain user with Administrator rights on all machines\n \t* Enter the password and click Apply\n\nSTEP 3: CONFIGURE LOCAL SECURITY POLICIES ON LANGUARD SERVER\n\n \t* Press Windows + R, type gpedit.msc and press Enter\n \t* Navigate to Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment\n \t* Add your domain account to these policies:\n\n- Replace a process level token\n- Adjust memory quotas for process\n- Log on as a batch job\n\n \t* Restart the GFI LanGuard XX Attendant service\n\nSTEP 4: CONFIGURE TARGET MACHINE(S)\n\nOn the Windows 11 target machine(s) that are failing:\n\n \t* Press Windows + R, type secpol.msc and press Enter\n \t* Expand Local Policies > User Rights Assignment\n \t* Find Log on as a service, right-click and open Properties\n \t* Click Add User or Group and add your domain account\n \t* Click Apply and OK\n\nYou can find the complete detailed steps here: Remediation Jobs or LanGuard Agent Install Status Stuck at Pending State [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122673]\n\nHave you had a chance to verify any of these settings yet, or would you like me to walk you through any specific step? \n\n--- Customer (Robert Murray) ---\n\n the credentials work because i'm able to install other windows patches \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Ah, that's a really important detail - thank you! If other Windows patches are deploying successfully with the same credentials, then we can rule out the general permissions issue. This means the error 552 is specific to this particular cumulative update (KB5066861 for Windows 11 24H2).\n\nSince the error is happening with this specific update while others work fine, this points to one of these scenarios:\n\nMOST LIKELY CAUSES:\n\n1. ISSUE WITH THE UPDATE FILE ITSELF\n\nThe error 552 The passed ACL did not contain the minimum required information could indicate a problem with how this specific update package is structured or downloaded. Let's verify this:\n\nCan you try manually installing this update on one of the affected Windows 11 machines?\n\n \t* Download KB5066861 directly from the Microsoft Update Catalog [https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/] \n \t* Try to manually install it by double-clicking the .msu file on the target machine\n \t* See if you get the same error or if it installs successfully\n\nThis will help us determine if the issue is with the update file itself or with how LanGuard is deploying it.\n\n2. CORRUPT WINDOWS UPDATE COMPONENTS ON TARGET MACHINES\n\nSince this is specific to Windows 11 24H2 machines, there might be corrupt Windows Update components on those systems. You can try running the Windows Update Troubleshooter or using DISM to repair the update components: Fixing Corrupt Windows Update Components [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122365]\n\n3. CUSTOM DEPLOYMENT WORKAROUND\n\nIf the standard deployment continues to fail, you could deploy this update using LanGuard's Custom Software Deployment feature with a batch file, similar to how emergency updates are handled: Template to push out common Windows updates [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122594]\n\nBefore we go down those paths - have you tried manually installing this specific update on any of the affected machines yet? \n\n--- Customer (Robert Murray) ---\n\n It happens with all the cumulative updates dating back several months \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Okay, now that's a very significant pattern - if ALL cumulative updates for Windows 11 24H2 are failing with the same error 552 going back several months, but other types of patches work fine, this points to something specific about how Windows 11 24H2 handles cumulative updates or how LanGuard interacts with that particular OS version.\n\nThis is looking like it could be:\n\n \t* A Windows 11 24H2-specific issue with how cumulative updates are structured or deployed\n \t* A compatibility issue between LanGuard and Windows 11 24H2's update mechanism\n \t* A Windows Update component issue specific to these machines\n\nLet me ask a few clarifying questions to help narrow this down:\n\n1. Are these Windows 11 24H2 machines able to install cumulative updates successfully through Windows Update directly? (Not through LanGuard - just using the built-in Windows Update)\n\n2. What version of GFI LanGuard are you currently running? (This is important because there might be compatibility considerations with Windows 11 24H2)\n\n3. Are you experiencing this issue on ALL Windows 11 24H2 machines, or just some of them?\n\n4. Do other types of updates (like definition updates, security updates that aren't cumulative, etc.) deploy successfully to these same Windows 11 24H2 machines through LanGuard?\n\nThe fact that it's specifically cumulative updates and specifically on Windows 11 24H2 suggests this might require either a LanGuard update/patch, a workaround using custom deployment, or potentially addressing something on the Windows 11 24H2 machines themselves. Your answers will help me determine the best path forward! \n\n--- Customer (Robert Murray) ---\n\n i can install them manually but not using gfi \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Perfect! That's the key piece of information - if you can install them manually but not through GFI LanGuard, this tells us the issue is specifically with how LanGuard is deploying these cumulative updates to Windows 11 24H2, not with the updates themselves or the target machines.\n\nThe error 552 The passed ACL did not contain the minimum required information combined with this pattern strongly suggests there's something about LanGuard's deployment method that Windows 11 24H2 doesn't like when it comes to cumulative updates specifically.\n\nHERE&#39;S WHAT I RECOMMEND:\n\nIMMEDIATE WORKAROUND: USE CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT\n\nSince manual installation works, you can use LanGuard's Custom Software Deployment feature to deploy these cumulative updates using a different method. This bypasses the standard patch deployment process that's causing the error.\n\nHere's how: Template to push out common Windows updates like Cumulative Updates via LanGuard's Custom Software Deployment feature [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122594]\n\nBasic steps:\n\n \t* Download the cumulative update .msu file from the Microsoft Update Catalog\n \t* Create a batch file with the command: wusa.exe [update-filename].msu /quiet /norestart\n \t* Deploy both files using LanGuard's Custom Software Deployment feature\n\nThis should work because it uses a different deployment mechanism than the standard patch deployment.\n\nLONG-TERM SOLUTION: CONTACT SUPPORT\n\nHowever, since this is affecting all Windows 11 24H2 cumulative updates consistently, this really sounds like something that needs to be investigated by the support team. This could be:\n\n \t* A known compatibility issue with Windows 11 24H2\n \t* Something that needs to be addressed in a LanGuard update\n \t* A specific configuration issue that needs deeper investigation\n\nWould you like me to connect you with a live support agent who can investigate this further and potentially escalate it if it's a broader compatibility issue? They'll be able to look at your specific environment, check logs, and determine if this is something that needs to be addressed at a product level. \n\n--- Customer (Robert Murray) ---\n\n yes please \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thank you for confirming! \ud83d\ude0a A human colleague will be happy to assist you further\u2014please feel free to choose from the available options to connect with a live support agent. \n\n--- Customer (Robert Murray) ---\n\n Button selection: [\ud83d\udce9 Raise a ticket] \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Please provide any other additional details we might need to investigate and resolve your issue.\n\nYou can use Shift+Enter if you want to continue typing in a new line.\n\nFor now, I am unable to take any file uploads, so any relevant log files or attachments can be provided directly in the ticket once I create it for you.\n\n \ud83d\udccc Important: Your ticket will be created in one of two ways:\n\n\t* Immediately after you provide the requested information above, or\n\n\t* Automatically after 5 minutes if no response is received\n\nPlease keep this browser/chat window open until you receive your ticket number as confirmation. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n It looks like you might not have anything to add?\nJust a reminder a ticket will be automatically created in 3 minutes, I'll proceed with the information I already have \ud83d\ude03 \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n It looks like you might not have anything to add?\nJust letting you know that if I don't receive further input within the next 30 seconds, I'll proceed with the information I already have \ud83d\ude03 \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n If you want to add additional \ud83d\udce7 email addresses in the ticket CC, please specify them below.\n\nYou can specify multiple email addresses, separated by a comma (for example: test@example.com, test2@example.com)\n\nOtherwise, just click the button \ud83d\udc47 \n"
