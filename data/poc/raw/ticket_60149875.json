          "Kayako - ticket id 60149875 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Jessica,\n\nThank you for your follow-up regarding the persistent issue with the \u201cRole does not equal\u201d filter in Community Analytics for the Emerging Leaders Forum. We understand the urgency and appreciate the detailed information, screenshots, and CSV exports you have provided.\n\nSummary of Observations:\nYour testing confirms that when you apply the filter Role equals (Administrator, Moderator, LPL Home Office), only those users appear as expected. However, when you apply the filter Role does not equal (Administrator, Moderator, LPL Home Office), those same users are still included in the results for the Emerging Leaders Forum, which is not the intended behavior. This issue appears isolated to this specific forum, as clearing the browser cache resolved similar issues for other communities.\n\nRelevant Product Behavior and Limitations:\nBased on the official documentation (Apply filters to Community Analytics reports [https://khoros-classic.kayako.com/article/125911] and Tips on using advanced filters for Community Analytics [https://khoros-classic.kayako.com/article/125912]), the Role filter is designed to include or exclude users based on their assigned roles. However, there are known limitations when users have multiple roles assigned: the filter may not fully exclude users who match any of the specified roles if they also have additional roles. This is consistent with the behavior you are experiencing.\n\nAdditional points from the documentation:\n\n \t* Filter rules are case sensitive. Ensure that role names are entered exactly as they appear in your role list.\n \t* You can enter multiple values in each rule as a comma-separated list (no spaces after the comma).\n \t* When users have overlapping or multiple roles, the \u201cdoes not equal\u201d filter may not exclude them as intended.\n\nRecommended Workaround:\nAs a reliable workaround, you can export the full member data for the Emerging Leaders Forum and apply additional filtering in Excel or another analytics tool to exclude users with the specified roles. The export includes a Role column, which allows you to filter out users with Admin, Moderator, or LPL Home Office roles manually.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions on applying filters and exporting member data, please refer to the following articles:\n\n \t* Apply filters to Community Analytics reports [https://khoros-classic.kayako.com/article/125911]\n \t* Tips on using advanced filters for Community Analytics [https://khoros-classic.kayako.com/article/125912]\n \t* Analytics Filters and Exporting Reports [https://khoros-classic.kayako.com/article/125006]\n\nSummary:\nThe behavior you are experiencing is a known limitation of the Community Analytics filtering logic when users have multiple roles assigned. While the Role equals filter works as expected, the Role does not equal filter may not fully exclude users with overlapping roles. Exporting the data and applying additional filtering externally is currently the most reliable solution.\n\nIf you have any further questions about filter configuration, analytics reporting, or need clarification on the export process, please let us know. We are here to assist you as you continue your analysis.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nKhoros Community Classic Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

I am still having trouble with the Emerging Leaders Forum when attempting to exclude (not equal) certain roles (i.e. Administrator, Moderator, LPL Home Office). I attempted all the solutions recommended in the previous email, and while clearing browsing cache worked for the other communities (Atria, LPL Innovators), none of these worked for the Emerging Leaders. As shown below, when I apply the filter to equal Admin, Moderator, and LPL Home Office, the individuals under these roles only appear as intended. However, when I apply the filter to not equal Admin, Moderator, and LPL Home Office, they also appear in this report which is not the intended result. I\u2019ve also attached the exports. \n\n\u00a0\n\nCan we please have someone investigate this urgently?

          "Kayako - ticket id 60149875 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Jessica,\n\nThank you for your update and for letting us know that you are still reviewing the information regarding the Community Analytics Reporting filters.\n\nTo summarize, when applying multiple Role, not equals filters in Community Analytics, users with those roles (such as Admin, LPL Home Office, and Moderator) may still appear in the results if they have multiple roles assigned or if there are overlapping role assignments. This is a known limitation of the filtering logic in Community Analytics.\n\nFor your reference, here are some best practices and resources to help you achieve more accurate filtering:\n\n \t* Filter Logic: When using several not equals filters for the same field, the system is designed to exclude users matching any of the specified roles. However, if a user has multiple roles, they may not be fully excluded. Reviewing user role assignments in your user management section can help clarify if overlapping roles are affecting your results.\n \t* Advanced Filtering: For more complex scenarios, consider using a combination of equals and not equals filters, or grouping filters where possible. The article Tips on using advanced filters for Community Analytics [https://community.khoros.com/t5/Community-Analytics/Tips-on-using-advanced-filters-for-Community-Analytics/ta-p/625912] provides additional strategies for refining your reports.\n \t* Exporting and Reviewing Data: If the exported CSV data still includes users with excluded roles, ensure that the filter criteria are correctly set before export. Sometimes, refreshing the report or clearing your browser cache can help apply the latest filter settings.\n \t* Known Limitations and Workarounds: If users with excluded roles continue to appear due to multi-role assignments, you may need to export the full data set and apply additional filtering in Excel or another analytics tool as a temporary workaround.\n\n\t* Step-by-Step Guidance: For detailed instructions on applying filters and downloading member metrics, please refer to the following articles: \n\n \t* Apply filters to Community Analytics reports [https://community.khoros.com/t5/Community-Analytics/Apply-filters-to-Community-Analytics-reports/ta-p/625911]\n \t* View and download community member metrics [https://community.khoros.com/t5/Community-Analytics/View-and-download-community-member-metrics/ta-p/625934]\n\nIf you have any further questions or need clarification on filter setup or analytics reporting, please let us know.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60149875 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Jessica,\n\nThank you for your prompt response and for providing the requested details regarding the issue with filters not working as expected in Community Analytics Reporting.\n\nBased on your description, it appears that when applying multiple \"Role, not equals\" filters in the Community Analytics reports, users with those roles (such as Admin, LPL Home Office, and Moderator) are still appearing in the results, particularly under the Members tab for the specified boards. This is not the expected behavior, as the filters should exclude those roles from the report output.\n\nRecommended Steps and Considerations:\n\n1. Review Filter Logic:\nWhen using multiple \"not equals\" filters for the same field (e.g., Role), the filter logic in Community Analytics is designed to exclude users who match any of the specified roles. However, if a user has multiple roles assigned, or if there are custom role hierarchies, the filter may not behave as intended. Please ensure that each user has only one of the roles being filtered, or consider using a combination of \"equals\" and \"not equals\" filters for more precise results.\n\n2. Advanced Filtering Tips:\nRefer to our article Apply filters to Community Analytics reports [https://community.khoros.com/t5/Community-Analytics/Apply-filters-to-Community-Analytics-reports/ta-p/625911] for guidance on setting up filters. For more complex scenarios, the article Tips on using advanced filters for Community Analytics [https://community.khoros.com/t5/Community-Analytics/Tips-on-using-advanced-filters-for-Community-Analytics/ta-p/625912] provides additional strategies, such as grouping filters or using \"OR\" and \"AND\" logic where available.\n\n3. Exported Data Review:\nIf the exported CSV data still includes users with excluded roles, double-check the filter criteria before export. Sometimes, the UI may display cached results; refreshing the report or clearing browser cache can help ensure the latest filter settings are applied.\n\n4. Known Limitations:\nThere are known limitations when filtering by roles if users have overlapping or multiple roles. In such cases, the filter may not exclude all intended users. As a workaround, you may need to adjust your role assignments or use additional filters (such as filtering by specific board names or user attributes) to refine your results.\n\n5. Viewing and Downloading Metrics:\nFor step-by-step instructions on viewing and downloading member metrics, please see View and download community member metrics [https://community.khoros.com/t5/Community-Analytics/View-and-download-community-member-metrics/ta-p/625934].\n\nExample:\nIf you wish to exclude users with roles Admin, LPL Home Office, and Moderator, ensure your filters are set as follows:\n\n \t* Role not equals Admin\n \t* Role not equals LPL Home Office\n \t* Role not equals Moderator\n\n If users still appear, verify their role assignments in the user management section to confirm they do not have additional roles that may affect filter logic.\n\nIf after reviewing these steps the issue persists, it may be due to a product limitation regarding multi-role filtering. In such cases, consider exporting the full data set and applying additional filtering in Excel or another analytics tool as a temporary workaround.\n\nFor further details on filter configuration and best practices, please refer to the articles linked above.\n\nWe hope this guidance helps you achieve the desired reporting outcome. If you have any additional questions or require clarification on the filter setup, please let us know.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nKhoros Community Classic Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.
