What specific problem with GFI Archiver were you experiencing when you opened this ticket? \nMichelle Donnelly:\n\n The journaling mailbox is not connecting and emails are not archiving \nChat Support:\n\n Thank you for providing more information about your issue with ticket #60010193. I understand that the journaling mailbox is not connecting and emails are not being archived. This is a serious concern, and I'll be happy to guide you through some troubleshooting steps.\n\nFirst, let's verify a few important settings:\n\n1. Journal Mailbox Connection:\n- Navigate to Configuration > Mail Servers to Archive\n- Select the Journal Mailbox and click Edit\n- Complete the wizard and verify that the connection test is successful\n- Ensure the journal mailbox is set to Active\n\n2. Journaling Configuration:\n- Confirm that journaling is enabled for all Microsoft Exchange databases and working correctly in Microsoft Exchange\n\n3. Archive Store Summary:\n- Go to Configuration > Archive Stores\n- Click Summary of the active archive store\n- Check the Last Email Archived On date and time\n\nIf you've already checked these settings and the issue persists, we can try the following:\n\n1. Restart GFI Services:\n- Open services.msc and restart all GFI-related services\n\n2. Journal Mailbox Access:\n- Confirm you can access the journal mailbox through OWA or Outlook\n- If you can't access it, the account might be locked out in Active Directory or the credentials may be incorrect\n\n3. Check Journal Mailbox Content:\n- If no emails are in the journal mailbox, verify that journaling is enabled for the appropriate mailbox type\n- If emails are stuck in the journal mailbox, check the total size of emails and attachments\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, we may need to gather more information:\n\n1. Collect troubleshooting logs\n2. Provide information on the type of Journal Mailbox configured\n3. Specify the type of database in use\n\nIf you've already tried these steps or need further assistance, please let me know, and we can escalate this to our support team for a more in-depth investigation.\n\n-------------------------\n\nFor more details check:\n\ud83d\udc49 Archiver not archiving emails [https://support.archiver.gfi.com/article/106311] \nChat Support:\n\n Take all the time you need to read through the provided resources \u261d\ufe0f\nI'll stay here in case you need anything else \ud83d\ude00\n\n-------------------------\n\nWas this helpful? \nMichelle Donnelly:\n\n emails are not archiving since Monday and i need to speak to someone \nChat Support:\n\n Of course!
