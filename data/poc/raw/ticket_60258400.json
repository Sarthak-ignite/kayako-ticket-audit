          "Kayako - ticket id 60258400 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Ond\u0159ej,\n\nThank you for sharing the log files and confirming that you have already attempted all the previously suggested solutions regarding the persistent \"The patch detection data package is unavailable\" error in GFI LanGuard.\n\nBased on the information provided and the relevant knowledge base articles, here are the most targeted next steps and root causes to review when the patch management database or update definitions remain persistently unavailable despite following standard procedures:\n\n1. Patch Management Database Integrity and Propagation\n\n \t* Ensure that lanss_xx_patchmngmt.mdb exists and is not corrupted on both the LanGuard server and the affected agent (C:\\ProgramData\\GFI\\LanGuard 12\\PatchManagement\\).\n \t* If you have previously copied a clean database to either location, verify that the timestamp is recent and that it is not immediately being deleted or replaced after a scan attempt, which could indicate an environmental or permission issue.\n\nReference: Handling 'The patch management database is unavailable' Error [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122919]\n\n2. Required Permissions and Security Interference\n\n \t* Both the LanGuard server and agent need full access permissions to the program data and update folders. Restricted NTFS permissions or security policies may prevent the creation or update of required files.\n \t* Temporarily disable any third-party antivirus, endpoint protection, or Windows Defender on both systems and verify if the problem is resolved after doing so and running a fresh scan. If so, implement long-term exclusions for the entire LanGuard data folders.\n\n3. Explicit Patch Definitions Synchronization\n\n\t* Use the manual force-update process (see manual update article [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/123069-updating-languard-server-manually-when-unable-to-get-current-updates-or-agents-do-not-pull-latest-definitions-from-server] and Forcing an update for the patch definitions [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/123074])\u2014but pay special attention to the additional step: \n\n \t* After updating the server, deploy the current lanss_12_patchmngmt.mdb and wsusscn2.cab files to all agents missing definitions directly using the Deploy Custom Software job from the Remediation Center, as instructed in the article.\n \t* Verify after deployment that these files are present on the client machine and that scans subsequently complete with accurate patch status.\n\n4. Connectivity and DNS Resolution\n\n \t* Both LAN and agent systems must perform both forward and reverse DNS lookups for each other and connect via the correct IP and port (typically TCP 1072 for v12+).\n \t* On the client, open Internet Explorer and download http://<LanGuardServerIP>:1072/files/update/wsusscn2.cab to check direct file access. If this fails, address underlying DNS or firewall issues.\n\n5. Additional Edge Cases\n\n \t* If you are running any custom scanning profiles, ensure patch scanning is enabled in the profile settings.\n \t* On older Windows OS (such as Windows 7/2008), verify all SHA-2 and ESU updates are present if scanning those systems, per the Supported Security Patch article [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122467].\n \t* Check the log files you provided for errors related to the Patch Management Database (such as missing file, permission denied, or I/O errors) or failed attempts to connect to the update site or GFI update servers.\n\nKey references for these troubleshooting steps:\n\n \t* Handling 'The patch management database is unavailable' Error [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122919]\n \t* Forcing an update for the patch definitions on the LanGuard server and connected Agents [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/123074]\n \t* Why LanGuard Is Not Detecting All Missing Patches? [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122467]\n\nAfter performing these targeted steps\u2014especially the explicit redeployment of the database and definitions to affected agents\u2014initiate a scan and review the agent's debug logs for improvement or changes in error messages. These will often point directly to permission, connectivity, or integrity issues as remaining blockers.\n\nIf the issue remains after the above, review any recent real-time protection, permission, or system policy changes that might be reverting or blocking access to C:\\ProgramData\\GFI\\LanGuard 12\\PatchManagement\\ on either the server or agent. Pay close attention to any log entries about access denied or file deletion events following patch definition deployments.\n\nShould you need further insight, reviewing specific error patterns or file access failures in the uploaded logs may reveal the root cause preventing the patch detection files from being created, distributed, or used on affected endpoints.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - LanGuard Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.

Verify Patch Management Database File Presence and Health:\n\n \t* On both the LanGuard server and affected agent machine (e.g., ZM-DOCHAZKA), navigate to C:\\ProgramData\\GFI\\LanGuard 12\\PatchManagement\\.\n \t* Ensure the file lanss_xx_patchmngmt.mdb exists. If it is missing or corrupt, this will cause the reported error.\n \t* Check that the drive is not full or nearly full, as insufficient disk space can prevent the patch database from being created or updated.\n\nReference: Handling 'The patch management database is unavailable' Error [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122919]\n\n2. Confirm Proper DNS and Network Connectivity:\n\n \t* Both the server and agent must resolve each other's IP addresses and hostnames correctly, enabling forward and reverse DNS lookups.\n \t* Test access by downloading the patch file from the agent or relay using Internet Explorer (it uses the same engine as LanGuard) with the address format: \nhttp://<LanGuardServerIP>:<Port>/files/update/wsusscn2.cab \n(Replace LanGuardServerIP and Port with actual values, typically port 1072 for v12+) \n \t* If the download does not complete, there is likely a networking or DNS issue affecting connectivity.\n\nReference: Handling 'The patch management database is unavailable' Error [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122919]\n\n3. Check for VPN/Firewall Interference:\n\n \t* Temporarily disable any VPN or third-party firewall/cybersecurity software on the affected systems and re-run the scan. If this resolves the issue, address the necessary exclusions in your security products.\n\nReference: Resolving \"Failed to install patch scan pre-requisite\" scanning issue [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122407]\n\n4. Confirm Required Patch Management and Scanning Settings:\n\n \t* Ensure all required configuration settings for successful scan and patch installation are in place, as described in the following article: Required Settings to Scan a Machine and Successfully Install Missing Patches [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122407].\n\n5. Validate LanGuard Services:\n\n \t* Ensure that all LanGuard services are running on the server (especially the GFI LanGuard Attendant Service). A restart of these services may sometimes resolve issues caused by temporary lockups or resource glitches.\n\nAfter completing the above steps, perform a new scan on the previously affected client(s) to check if the error is resolved.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues after these checks, please gather: \n\n \t* The LanGuard debug logs from C:\\ProgramData\\GFI\\LanGuard 12\\DebugLogs\\ on both the server and the affected agent.\n \t* The scan results for the problematic machines.\n\n You may analyze these logs to help pinpoint whether the database file is missing/corrupt, if network connectivity issues are present, or if there are errors communicating with the update sites.\n\nFor in-depth references and examples, please see:\n\n \t* Handling 'The patch management database is unavailable' Error [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122919]\n \t* Resolving \"Failed to install patch scan pre-requisite\" scanning issue [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122407]\n \t* Why LanGuard Is Not Detecting All Missing Patches? [https://support.languard.gfi.com/article/122467]\n\nIf the issue persists after these steps, continued log analysis as indicated above may uncover the exact root cause, such as database corruption or environmental/networking issues.\n\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - LanGuard Support Team.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis response contains information generated with 3rd party components for which we disclaim all responsibility.
