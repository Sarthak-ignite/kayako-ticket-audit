Based on the minimal information provided, this appears to be a request to create or provision subscription-based licensing for the G2 2011 product. Subscription licenses typically have time-limited validity and may include specific feature sets or user counts depending on the subscription tier.Implementation ConsiderationsThe implementation of subscription license generation for G2 2011 requires consideration of several technical aspects:Without additional context, it's difficult to provide more specific implementation details. The ticket would benefit from clarification on the quantity of licenses needed, specific parameters, and the intended delivery mechanism.Affected ComponentsBased on the limited information, the following components are likely to be affected:Similar ImplementationsNo information available on similar implementations due to limited knowledge base access. It would be helpful to review previous license generation tickets for G2 products to understand the established processes and any potential issues encountered.Technical DependenciesThe license generation process likely depends on:Implementation RecommendationsBased on the limited information available, I recommend:Expected BenefitsGenerating subscription licenses for G2 2011 will:SourcesNo URL placeholders were provided in the knowledge base findings due to an authentication error (401) when querying Dashworks."

I can help you with that. To raise a ticket for a Gensym G2 license request, I'll need to gather some information first so our support team can process this efficiently.\n\nBased on our license request process [https://gensym-ignitetech.kayako.com/article/53090], I'll need the following details:\n\nCurrent License Details:\n\n \t* What version of G2 do you need the license for? (Note: Gensym only issues licenses for G2 2021 and later versions)\n \t* What type of license do you need? (Development, Restricted, Runtime, or Embedded)\n \t* Is this a new license, a renewal, or an extension?\n\nCould you start by telling me which version of G2 you need the license for? \n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n 2011 subscription license \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I need to let you know something important about your request. According to our licensing policy, Gensym does not issue licenses for G2 versions prior to 2021. You've mentioned you need a license for G2 2011, which unfortunately falls outside of what our support team can provide.\n\nFor G2 2011 or any other pre-2021 versions, you would need to contact your account manager directly to discuss your options.\n\nA few questions to help clarify your situation:\n\n \t* Is G2 2011 the version you absolutely need, or could you potentially upgrade to G2 2021 or later?\n \t* Are you currently under an active Gensym contract that might allow for an upgrade discussion?\n\nIf you'd like, I can connect you with our support team who can help route you to the appropriate account manager to discuss licensing options for older versions. What would work best for you? \n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n Absolutely need it and it is covered by contract \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Understood. Since you absolutely need G2 2011 and it's covered by your contract, I can help you get this request to our support team who will work with the appropriate resources to handle your license request.\n\nBefore I connect you with a live agent to create the ticket, let me gather a few more details to make the process smoother:\n\nWhat type of license do you need?\n\n \t* Site license (can be used on any number of machines)\n \t* Perpetual license (bound to a specific machine ID)\n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n These are subscription licenses \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Perfect, thank you for clarifying that these are subscription licenses.\n\nTo complete the information for your ticket, I need just a couple more details:\n\nDo you have the Gensym Authorization Request form filled out? This form typically includes:\n\n \t* Your organization details\n \t* Machine ID information\n \t* Number of Telewindows connections needed\n \t* Content of your previous license file (g2.ok file) if this is a renewal\n\nIf you have the form ready, you can upload it using the Secure File Upload [https://files.eswsecuretransfers.com/customers?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzZXNzaW9uX3V1aWQiOiJmNjFjOTg0My00MTdkLTQ5ZmYtOTliZC1jNzUwNzEyZTE2M2EiLCJzZXNzaW9uX3VpZCI6ImY2MWM5ODQzLTQxN2QtNDlmZi05OWJkLWM3NTA3MTJlMTYzYSIsImVtYWlsIjoia2FpLndpc3NlckBlbmJyaWRnZS5jb20iLCJjdXN0b21lcl9wYXJzZXIiOnt9LCJjYWxsYmFjayI6eyJjYWxsYmFja191cmwiOm51bGwsImNhbGxiYWNrX2VtYWlsIjoiY2lwcmlhbi5uYXN0YXNlQHRyaWxvZ3kuY29tIn0sInByb2R1Y3RfdGFnIjoiZ2Vuc3ltIiwicXVlcnkiOiIiLCJleHAiOjE3NjQxOTEyMjB9.H7MnhtwJWMHgP4nh80NkVGgnQrj2evhMj1-6N4U8MiE] portal, or if you don't have it yet, our support team can guide you through that process.\n\nAlso, is this a renewal of an existing license or a new license request? \n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n Yes \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I appreciate your response, but I want to make sure I understand correctly since I asked two separate questions:\n\n \t* Do you have the Authorization Request form filled out and ready to upload?\n\n \t* Is this a renewal of an existing license or a new license request?\n\nCould you clarify which one (or both) you're saying yes to? \n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n I have an authorization request and this is a replacement for an existing license \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Perfect! Thank you for that clarification. So you have the authorization request form ready and this is a replacement for an existing G2 2011 subscription license.\n\nSince you have the authorization form ready, please go ahead and upload it using the Secure File Upload [https://files.eswsecuretransfers.com/customers?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzZXNzaW9uX3V1aWQiOiJmNjFjOTg0My00MTdkLTQ5ZmYtOTliZC1jNzUwNzEyZTE2M2EiLCJzZXNzaW9uX3VpZCI6ImY2MWM5ODQzLTQxN2QtNDlmZi05OWJkLWM3NTA3MTJlMTYzYSIsImVtYWlsIjoia2FpLndpc3NlckBlbmJyaWRnZS5jb20iLCJjdXN0b21lcl9wYXJzZXIiOnt9LCJjYWxsYmFjayI6eyJjYWxsYmFja191cmwiOm51bGwsImNhbGxiYWNrX2VtYWlsIjoiY2lwcmlhbi5uYXN0YXNlQHRyaWxvZ3kuY29tIn0sInByb2R1Y3RfdGFnIjoiZ2Vuc3ltIiwicXVlcnkiOiIiLCJleHAiOjE3NjQxOTEyMjB9.H7MnhtwJWMHgP4nh80NkVGgnQrj2evhMj1-6N4U8MiE] portal. Once you've uploaded it, let me know and I'll connect you with our support team who will create the ticket and work with the necessary resources to process your G2 2011 license replacement request.\n\nHave you uploaded the authorization form, or would you like to do that now? \n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n I can't login to the site. Can you please just raise the ticket? \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I understand the login issue is frustrating. Let me connect you with our support team right away. They'll be able to create the ticket for your G2 2011 subscription license replacement and work with you on getting the authorization form submitted through an alternative method.\n\nJust to summarize what I'll pass along to them:\n\n \t* Request: G2 2011 subscription license replacement\n \t* Issue: Customer has authorization form ready but cannot login to the secure upload portal\n \t* Contract Status: Covered by existing contract\n\nLet me transfer you to a live agent now who can help you complete this request. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I understand the difficulty you're facing with the login. \ud83d\ude0a A human colleague is available to assist you further\u2014please feel free to choose from the handover options when you're ready. \n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n Button selection: [\ud83d\udce9 Raise a ticket] \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Please provide any other additional details we might need to investigate and resolve your issue.\n\nYou can use Shift+Enter if you want to continue typing in a new line.\n\n \ud83d\udccc Important: Your ticket will be created in one of two ways:\n\n\t* Immediately after you provide the requested information above, or\n\n\t* Automatically after 5 minutes if no response is received\n\nPlease keep this browser/chat window open until you receive your ticket number as confirmation. \n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n none \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n If you want to add additional \ud83d\udce7 email addresses in the ticket CC, please specify them below.\n\nYou can specify multiple email addresses, separated by a comma (for example: test@example.com, test2@example.com)\n\nOtherwise, just click the button \ud83d\udc47 \n\n--- Customer (Kai Wisser) ---\n\n Pipesked.support@enbridge.com \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n \ud83d\udc4c Got it!\n\nThese email addresses will be added to the ticket CC: Pipesked.support@enbridge.com \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I've automatically set the ticket subject to: Gensym license replacement request\n\nDoes that work for you?\n\n \t* If it does, simply say YES or use the below button to confirm \ud83d\udc47\n \t* If not, please directly type in the ticket subject of your choosing below \ud83d\ude09\n\n"
