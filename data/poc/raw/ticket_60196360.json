Let's dig into your issue with lost handovers from Khoros Flow to Care.\n\nJust to confirm, when you say lost handovers, do you mean that conversations initiated in Flow are not appearing in Care at all, or are they showing up with missing information or delays? Also, is this happening for all conversations or only certain types/channels?\n\nCould you share:\n- When did you first notice this issue?\n- Does it happen consistently, or only at certain times?\n- Are there any error messages or logs visible in either Flow or Care?\n\nThis info will help me narrow down the possible causes and guide you more effectively! \nCarsten Schmitt-Hoeppner:\n\n we see this since a few days, it is not sonsistently nor in specific flows, it happens randomly. there are no errors in flow, we have analyzed the logs and can not see any reason why the convo is not appearing in flow \nChat Support:\n\n Thanks for the details! It sounds like the handover issue is intermittent, not tied to specific flows, and there are no errors in your Flow logs. Since this started a few days ago and you\u2019ve already checked the logs, let\u2019s consider a few possibilities:\n\n1. Integration/Configuration Delays or Filters: Sometimes, delays or specific configuration settings between Flow and Care can cause content to not appear as expected. For example, there might be per-board delays or routing rules that could impact when or if a conversation appears in Care. You can review more about these settings in this article: Configure your community to escalate content to Khoros Care [https://khoros-classic.kayako.com/article/125064].\n\n2. Content Moderation or Filtering: In some cases, content may be filtered out or held for moderation, which could explain why it doesn\u2019t show up in Care. This is more common in communities with spam management or moderation tools enabled. For more on this, see: Community members have reported posts missing after posting. Where have these posts gone? [https://khoros-classic.kayako.com/article/125829].\n\nSince you\u2019ve already analyzed the logs and haven\u2019t found errors, and because this is a random/intermittent issue, it may require deeper investigation by our technical team.\n\nWould you like me to escalate this to a live support agent for further analysis? If so, could you please confirm:\n- The approximate date/time of the most recent lost handover\n- Any specific conversation IDs (if available) that failed to appear in Care\n\nThis info will help our team investigate more efficiently! \nChat Support:\n\n Just to confirm... you are saying that you are currently facing an outage, correct? \nCarsten Schmitt-Hoeppner:\n\n \u2705 Yes, correct \nChat Support:\n\n I'm sorry to hear about that!\nLet's get you some help straight away! \ud83d\udea8 \nCarsten Schmitt-Hoeppner:\n\n \ud83d\udce9 Raise a ticket \nChat Support:\n\n Thank you for confirming the outage and providing those Flow log links. Before I escalate this as an urgent ticket, I need to confirm one key detail:\n\nCould you please provide your Khoros instance URL? This is required for our support team to properly investigate and resolve the issue. The instance URL typically looks like:\n- yourcompany.community.com\n- yourcompany.khoros.com\n- or a similar format specific to your Khoros environment.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure where to find it, it\u2019s usually the address you use to log in to your Khoros Community or Care portal.\n\nOnce you provide this, I\u2019ll immediately raise your urgent support ticket. Thank you! \nCarsten Schmitt-Hoeppner:\n\n https://telekom.response.lithium.com/ \nChat Support:\n\n I've noted down your instance URL\ud83d\udd17: https://telekom.response.lithium.com/ \nChat Support:\n\n Please provide any other additional details we might need to investigate and resolve your issue.\n\nYou can use Shift+Enter if you want to continue typing in a new line.\n\nFor now, I am unable to take any file uploads, so any relevant log files or attachments can be provided directly in the ticket once I create it for you.\n\n Please note: the ticket will get created only after you provide the above requested information or after a 5-minute timeout. \nCarsten Schmitt-Hoeppner:\n\n here are some logs from flow where we are missing the convos: \nChat Support:\n\n If you want to add additional \ud83d\udce7 email addresses in the ticket CC, please specify them below.\n\nYou can specify multiple email addresses, separated by a comma (for example: test@example.com, test2@example.com)\n\nOtherwise, just click the button \ud83d\udc47 \nCarsten Schmitt-Hoeppner:\n\nhttps://app.flow.ai/a-2ioQPpQ/logs/details/%2B4915208872109%7C8e7e2a13-b87a-430a-a179-8f8e93e5fa9e/a8c023d8-7076-4e8a-a5c0-6c58c4d7cde1/activity/1757626596073_8d8d8ac6-47d0-444d-b1af-cd8f50298a7d_Creating%20internal%20note%20in%20care?channelId=8e7e2a13-b87a-430a-a179-8f8e93e5fa9e&createdAt=1757590574121\n\nhttps://app.flow.ai/a-2ioQPpQ/logs/details/%2B4915222092919%7C8e7e2a13-b87a-430a-a179-8f8e93e5fa9e/ce30a2ae-1bdc-49b1-b495-9628ca3df13a?channelId=8e7e2a13-b87a-430a-a179-8f8e93e5fa9e&createdAt=1757590605635\n\nChat Support:\n\n It doesn't seem like you provided valid email addresses to add to the ticket CC... \nChat Support:\n\n If you want to add additional \ud83d\udce7 email addresses in the ticket CC, please specify them below.\n\nYou can specify multiple email addresses, separated by a comma (for example: test@example.com, test2@example.com)\n\nOtherwise, just click the button \ud83d\udc47 \nCarsten Schmitt-Hoeppner:\n\n No additional email addresses required in CC \nChat Support:\n\n I've automatically set the ticket subject to: Missing Conversations from Flow to Care\n\nDoes that work for you?\n- If it does, simply say YES or use the below button to confirm \ud83d\udc47\n- If not, please directly type in the ticket subject of your choosing below \ud83d\ude09 "
