The issue is clearly originating from your product and now, according to your suggestion, the entire deployment has to be redone from scratch. Is this what your support standards look like?\n\nWe are talking about a banking client here, with over 300+ endpoints deployed across multiple branches nationwide. Asking for a complete redeployment is not a feasible solution and is causing a severe business impact.\n\nYou are required to join the next session with the client and personally clarify why this problem has occurred and how it will be fixed. This issue is from your backend, and you must own the responsibility instead of pushing for a complete redeployment.\n\nWe need an immediate escalation to your higher technical team and a clear resolution plan without any delays."

Change LPCTSTR to _bstr_t at for [timestamp](https://github.com/trilogy-group/gfi-languard/blob/89f922a52fbfd4b0cdc0eabf71fe95f2fe5c350a/Services/ScanMngSys/AgentScanManager.cpp#L1327)\n```\nauto timestamp = (LPCTSTR)now.Format(constants.FORMAT_LastOcurrenceDate);\n```\n\n2. Split save by saving one option at a time in [SaveLastAgentScanTimestamp](https://github.com/trilogy-group/gfi-languard/blob/89f922a52fbfd4b0cdc0eabf71fe95f2fe5c350a/Services/ScanMngSys/AgentScanManager.cpp#L1302C17-L1302C43)\n\n3. Verify the saved value by reading them again.\n\n4. Implement a local cache for recurring scan timestamp to avoid continuous reading from file.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nPR: https://github.com/trilogy-group/gfi-languard/pull/3392\n\nInstaller: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/13QWugUGRmXaslqhfnyOaHkyTJ3aVvp8I\n\n@keyursaxenacrossover, @anujkumar-df "

This will stop the repeated scans. The issue is caused by corruption in the <LastRecurringScan> tag.\n\nTo explain further: the LastRecurringScan value is used to track when the most recent recurring scan occurred. This allows the system to determine whether it\u2019s time to initiate the next scheduled scan based on your recurrence settings. If that value becomes corrupted, for example, due to a failed connection during a scan or a sync issue, the agent may continue to rescan repeatedly. Fortunately, this is usually a quick fix.\n\nPlease replace the file as described and let me know if the problem persists or if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nMarcio Zimerman\nGFI - LanGuard Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.
