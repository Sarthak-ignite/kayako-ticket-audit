          "GHI Engineering - 16366 // daniel-wachira commented: I believe this is a performance-related problem. The big hint is that these 2 items are true:\n1. The kernel notifications queue is filled and overflowing indicating high traffic.\n2. Some subnet statistics are collected while others are not.\n\nThe logic in collectord behaves like this:\n- If we receive a flow, try to attach to a network object id for stats collection.\n- If traffic is high and we are not processing the flows fast enough, drop the record. This is done in a loop so some records will be added and others will skip.\n\nA consequence of the above is that if a flow has multiple ids, it will likely not report traffic for all of them and will stop after filling in just enough to fill the queue.\n\nThe kernel notifications queue overflow was not being handled correctly before, this is now fixed. We now force-drain the queue if ENOBUFS is reported by the kernel. The buffer sizes on both user and kernel sides is also increased.\n\nNext, I shall review the queue processing to ensure we have no performance bubbles. A lot of internal processing is done with a 10 second timer, but I think we can move some of these out to a separate thread with a shorter interval to ensure resources are correctly utilized."

It's less to do with firmware and more to do with database initialization.\nWhat I am curious about is this - what was the initial version installed on the device and what was the initial upgrade done if any?\n\nN/B: There is a known issue going back forever where the manufacture second stage reboot can interrupt database upgrades. This also explains why sometimes after clean install exinda can misbehave and this issue affects every known version of exinda. I did some investigation on this a few months ago and logged the internal ticket https://github.com/trilogy-group/gfi-kanban/issues/2220 for that. A side effect of that is broken monitoring database post-install or upgrade with no simple fix available."

At this time, we are not observing the errors or issues that were present before the rebuild. Earlier, the reports were empty; however, after the rebuild, the reports are now populating with data.\n\nAs requested before, please share the specific subnet report that is currently showing the issue and clearly point out, with supporting evidence, what data you believe is missing from the report. Since the report is now populating, it is difficult for us to identify what may be missing based on the previously shared report. If certain IPs are missing from the subnet report while the rest of the report appears correct, please clearly explain this and highlight the missing details so that we can investigate further.\n\nAt this point, we can confirm that data is visible after the rebuild, and the issue appears to be partially resolved. The activities performed during the earlier meetings have resulted in measurable progress.\n\nWe look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Under this model, customers retain ownership of their production environments. Because your team has full visibility into operational details\u2014such as network dependencies, approved change windows, internal policies, and backup procedures\u2014it is important that changes or actions be applied directly by you within your environment.\n\nOur role in support is to provide clear, validated guidance, explain the purpose and expected outcome of each step, and assist you throughout the process. This approach is not a limitation in our willingness to help, but rather a safeguard to avoid unintended impact in environments where we do not have full operational visibility or ownership.\n\nIf you encounter any challenges or have questions while carrying out the steps, please rest assured that we are here to assist. At this stage, the recommended next step is to complete the procedure already shared at a time when the actions can be safely applied without potential impact, and then share the outcome with us.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60209095 // Randall Shawver commented publicly: Hello Sajeedali, Vaibhav, and team,\n\nThank you for your continued patience and for the detailed information, diagnostics, and screenshots you have shared. I understand this case has been ongoing for a long time and has impacted your operations, and I want to give you a clear, concrete way forward. You may also schedule a meeting at the bottom of this response.\n\n1. WHAT WE CONFIRMED FROM YOUR DIAGNOSTICS\n\nFrom the diagnostic bundle and the 24\u2011hour subnet report you provided:\n\n\t* The 24\u2011hour report for network object\u00a0Jindal_Virtue (26\u201327 Nov 2025) shows full inbound/outbound conversation data and application details, which confirms that the appliance can collect and report traffic correctly for at least some 24\u2011hour periods.\n\n\t* At the same time, the system log contains many errors like:\n\n\t* collectord: KernelNotifications: recvmsg() failed with error: No buffer space available\n\t* Kernel messages:\u00a0setpol notifications: failed to multicast.\n\n\t* These are known symptoms of the monitoring pipeline (collectord/datad/database) running into resource/buffer problems and failing to roll up data correctly, which leads to blank or partial graphs even when traffic is present. This is the scenario covered by the articles \u201cMonitoring graphs showing data gaps or no data at all\u201d and \u201cThe Monitoring Database Has Stopped or Become Corrupted.\u201d[2][1]\n\nThis matches exactly what you are seeing: some short/custom windows show data, some 24\u2011hour ranges work, but other periods (Last 24 Hours, Last 10 Minutes for particular objects) show \u201cData not available for selected period\u201d even though there was traffic.\n\n2. WHY THE SHELL KEY SHOWED \u201cPERMISSION DENIED\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpermission denied\u201d error you saw when entering the shell key is caused by where and how it was entered:\n\n\t* The restricted shell key is a\u00a0license string, not a CLI command. If you paste it directly at the\u00a0exinda-b080e5 # prompt, the system treats it as an invalid command and returns \u201c% Permission denied.\u201d\n\t* To use the restricted commands (such as\u00a0pm process ... and direct access to\u00a0/var/data/monitor), the key must first be installed as a\u00a0license, either in the Web UI or via the\u00a0license install command.[5][3]\n\nPlease use the newer shell key we sent:\nLK2-RESTRICTED_CMDS-45A0-GK0U-B107-5423-KXQ8-6GT4-7U1W-UC6F-UHJ1-QVK6-X1GF-5NHT-R\nand apply it using\u00a0one of the following methods:\nOption A \u2013 Web UI (recommended)\n\n\t* Log in to the Exinda Web UI.\n\t* Navigate to:\nConfiguration > System > Setup > License\n\t* Scroll to the bottom of the page.\n\t* Paste the above key into the license text area.\n\t* Click\u00a0Add Licenses.\n\nThen, in the CLI:\n\nen\n_shell\n\nshould immediately give you the shell prompt.\nOption B \u2013 CLI\n\n\t* Open a console/SSH session and run:\n\nen\nconf\u00a0t\nlicense\u00a0install\u00a0LK2-RESTRICTED_CMDS-45A0-GK0U-B107-5423-KXQ8-6GT4-7U1W-UC6F-UHJ1-QVK6-X1GF-5NHT-R\n\n\t* Then:\n\n_shell\n\nto access the shell.\nIf, after installing the new license, any\u00a0pm commands still fail, you can remove any old \u201cRestricted commands\u201d license entries from\u00a0Configuration > System > Setup > License and then re\u2011install this key, as described in the \u201cUnrecognized command \u2018pm\u2019 error\u201d article.[4]\n\n3. STEP\u2011BY\u2011STEP CORRECTIVE PLAN\n\nTo address the reporting gaps and restore stable subnet/application graphs, the recommended plan is:\n\nSTEP 1 \u2013 NON\u2011DESTRUCTIVE MONITORING STACK RESTART\n\nThis step does\u00a0not erase historical data and does not stop traffic forwarding. It may briefly affect the Web UI and reporting while services restart.\nFrom the CLI:\n\nen\nconf\u00a0t\nservice\u00a0jboss\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0datad\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0collector\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0database\u00a0restart\n\nPlease run each\u00a0service command one by one, waiting 1\u20132 minutes between commands to let each service stop and start cleanly.[1][2]\nAfter all four have been restarted, wait about 10\u201315 minutes and then check:\n\n\t* Monitor > Subnets and\u00a0Monitor > Traffic Analysis > Conversations\n\t* For both \u201cLast 10 Minutes\u201d and \u201cLast 24 Hours\u201d views, focusing on objects where you know there is current traffic.\n\nIf graphs and tables now populate correctly for those periods, you can stop here.\n\nSTEP 2 \u2013 MONITORING DATABASE RESET (DESTRUCTIVE; REQUIRES MAINTENANCE WINDOW)\n\nIf Step 1 does not resolve the issue, the monitoring database is very likely corrupted, and it must be rebuilt. This will\u00a0erase historical monitoring data only (traffic stats, flows, old graphs). It will\u00a0not affect:\n\n\t* Device configuration (virtual circuits, policies, objects, VLANs, users, etc.)\n\t* Live traffic forwarding or optimization, aside from a brief window while services restart.\n\nBefore doing this step:\n\n\t* Export any critical reports (PDF/CSV) you may need later for audit/compliance.\n\t* Download a configuration backup from the Web UI.\n\nThen:\n\n\t* Install the restricted shell license as described above.\n\t* Enter the shell and stop MySQL and clear the old monitoring data:\n\nen\n_shell\npm\u00a0process\u00a0mysqld\u00a0terminate\ncd\u00a0/var/data/monitor\nrm\u00a0-rf\u00a0*\nexit\n\n\t* Back in the CLI, rebuild and restart the monitoring stack:\n\nen\nconf\u00a0t\nclear\u00a0database\npm\u00a0process\u00a0mysqld\u00a0restart\npm\u00a0process\u00a0datad\u00a0restart\npm\u00a0process\u00a0collectord\u00a0restart\npm\u00a0process\u00a0monitord\u00a0restart\npm\u00a0process\u00a0jboss\u00a0restart\n\nAgain, run each\u00a0pm command one by one, with short pauses, to avoid overlapping restarts.[1]\nAfter this, give the appliance 10\u201315 minutes to rebuild the monitoring database and start populating new data. Then verify that:\n\n\t* \u201cLast 10 Minutes\u201d graphs show new traffic.\n\t* After some time, \u201cLast 24 Hours\u201d starts to show data for periods where traffic is present.\n\n4.

          "Kayako - ticket id 60209095 // Randall Shawver commented privately:  What is your proposed action?\n(required: select one, delete the rest) \n\n \t* Send to customer and also to meeting\n\n =============================================================== \n\nWHAT IS THE PR TO THE CUSTOMER?\n\n Hello Sajeedali, Vaibhav, and team, \n\n Thank you for your continued patience and for the detailed information, diagnostics, and screenshots you have shared. I understand this case has been ongoing for a long time and has impacted your operations, and I want to give you a clear, concrete way forward. You may also schedule a meeting at the bottom of this response. \n\n1. WHAT WE CONFIRMED FROM YOUR DIAGNOSTICS\n\n From the diagnostic bundle and the 24\u2011hour subnet report you provided: \n\n \t* \n The 24\u2011hour report for network object Jindal_Virtue (26\u201327 Nov 2025) shows full inbound/outbound conversation data and application details, which confirms that the appliance can collect and report traffic correctly for at least some 24\u2011hour periods. \n\n\t* \n At the same time, the system log contains many errors like: \n\n \t* collectord: KernelNotifications: recvmsg() failed with error: No buffer space available\n \t* Kernel messages: setpol notifications: failed to multicast.\n\n \t* \n These are known symptoms of the monitoring pipeline (collectord/datad/database) running into resource/buffer problems and failing to roll up data correctly, which leads to blank or partial graphs even when traffic is present. This is the scenario covered by the articles \u201cMonitoring graphs showing data gaps or no data at all\u201d and \u201cThe Monitoring Database Has Stopped or Become Corrupted.\u201d[2][1] \n\n This matches exactly what you are seeing: some short/custom windows show data, some 24\u2011hour ranges work, but other periods (Last 24 Hours, Last 10 Minutes for particular objects) show \u201cData not available for selected period\u201d even though there was traffic. \n\n2. WHY THE SHELL KEY SHOWED \u201cPERMISSION DENIED\u201d\n\n The \u201cpermission denied\u201d error you saw when entering the shell key is caused by where and how it was entered: \n\n \t* The restricted shell key is a license string, not a CLI command. If you paste it directly at the exinda-b080e5 # prompt, the system treats it as an invalid command and returns \u201c% Permission denied.\u201d\n \t* To use the restricted commands (such as pm process ... and direct access to /var/data/monitor), the key must first be installed as a license, either in the Web UI or via the license install command.[5][3]\n\n Please use the newer shell key we sent: \n LK2-RESTRICTED_CMDS-45A0-GK0U-B107-5423-KXQ8-6GT4-7U1W-UC6F-UHJ1-QVK6-X1GF-5NHT-R \n and apply it using one of the following methods: \n Option A \u2013 Web UI (recommended) \n\n \t* Log in to the Exinda Web UI.\n \t* Navigate to:\nConfiguration > System > Setup > License\n \t* Scroll to the bottom of the page.\n \t* Paste the above key into the license text area.\n \t* Click Add Licenses.\n\n Then, in the CLI: \n\nen\n_shell\n\n should immediately give you the shell prompt. \n Option B \u2013 CLI \n\n \t* Open a console/SSH session and run:\n\nen\nconf\u00a0t\nlicense\u00a0install\u00a0LK2-RESTRICTED_CMDS-45A0-GK0U-B107-5423-KXQ8-6GT4-7U1W-UC6F-UHJ1-QVK6-X1GF-5NHT-R\n\n \t* Then:\n\n_shell\n\n to access the shell. \n If, after installing the new license, any pm commands still fail, you can remove any old \u201cRestricted commands\u201d license entries from Configuration > System > Setup > License and then re\u2011install this key, as described in the \u201cUnrecognized command \u2018pm\u2019 error\u201d article.[4] \n\n3. STEP\u2011BY\u2011STEP CORRECTIVE PLAN\n\n To address the reporting gaps and restore stable subnet/application graphs, the recommended plan is: \n\nSTEP 1 \u2013 NON\u2011DESTRUCTIVE MONITORING STACK RESTART\n\n This step does not erase historical data and does not stop traffic forwarding. It may briefly affect the Web UI and reporting while services restart. \n From the CLI: \n\nen\nconf\u00a0t\nservice\u00a0jboss\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0datad\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0collector\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0database\u00a0restart\n\n Please run each service command one by one, waiting 1\u20132 minutes between commands to let each service stop and start cleanly.[1][2] \n After all four have been restarted, wait about 10\u201315 minutes and then check: \n\n \t* Monitor > Subnets and Monitor > Traffic Analysis > Conversations\n \t* For both \u201cLast 10 Minutes\u201d and \u201cLast 24 Hours\u201d views, focusing on objects where you know there is current traffic.\n\n If graphs and tables now populate correctly for those periods, you can stop here. \n\nSTEP 2 \u2013 MONITORING DATABASE RESET (DESTRUCTIVE; REQUIRES MAINTENANCE WINDOW)\n\n If Step 1 does not resolve the issue, the monitoring database is very likely corrupted, and it must be rebuilt. This will erase historical monitoring data only (traffic stats, flows, old graphs). It will not affect: \n\n \t* Device configuration (virtual circuits, policies, objects, VLANs, users, etc.)\n \t* Live traffic forwarding or optimization, aside from a brief window while services restart.\n\n Before doing this step: \n\n \t* Export any critical reports (PDF/CSV) you may need later for audit/compliance.\n \t* Download a configuration backup from the Web UI.\n\n Then: \n\n \t* Install the restricted shell license as described above.\n \t* Enter the shell and stop MySQL and clear the old monitoring data:\n\nen\n_shell\npm\u00a0process\u00a0mysqld\u00a0terminate\ncd\u00a0/var/data/monitor\nrm\u00a0-rf\u00a0*\nexit\n\n \t* Back in the CLI, rebuild and restart the monitoring stack:\n\nen\nconf\u00a0t\nclear\u00a0database\npm\u00a0process\u00a0mysqld\u00a0restart\npm\u00a0process\u00a0datad\u00a0restart\npm\u00a0process\u00a0collectord\u00a0restart\npm\u00a0process\u00a0monitord\u00a0restart\npm\u00a0process\u00a0jboss\u00a0restart\n\n Again, run each pm command one by one, with short pauses, to avoid overlapping restarts.[1] \n After this, give the appliance 10\u201315 minutes to rebuild the monitoring database and start populating new data. Then verify that: \n\n \t* \u201cLast 10 Minutes\u201d graphs show new traffic.\n \t* After some time, \u201cLast 24 Hours\u201d starts to show data for periods where traffic is present.\n\n4.

We provide: \n\n \t* Detailed diagnosis using the files you upload,\n \t* Documented and tested remediation steps,\n \t* Clarifications and follow\u2011up when commands do not behave as expected, but we do not operate your appliance directly or provide guaranteed real\u2011time, on\u2011call presence during customer\u2011scheduled activities.\n\n To make your next window as efficient as possible: \n\n \t* \n Please ensure the shell license is installed ahead of time using the steps above. \n\n\t* \n Plan the activity in two phases: \n\n \t* Step 1 (service restarts) first.\n \t* If graphs remain blank in periods where traffic is present, proceed to Step 2 (database reset) during the same window.\n\n \t* \n If you encounter any specific command errors or unexpected behavior during the procedure, capture the exact CLI output (or a screenshot) and share it in this ticket.

Backup and Restoration of Historical Monitoring Data\nExinda\u2019s configuration backup does not include the monitoring database or historical traffic/reporting data; it only retains system and appliance configuration. The monitoring database contains flow, conversation, and historical reporting data and is stored separately in /var/data/monitor. Exinda does not currently provide a built-in mechanism to export or restore the full raw monitoring database.\n\nBest Practice Before Clearing Data:\n\n\t* Manual Report Export: If retaining critical historical data is required, please export essential reports (PDF/CSV) for any necessary period or object before clearing the database. Use the Web UI reporting pages to generate and save these records.\n\t* No Database Restore Option: Once the clear database and rm -rf * (in /var/data/monitor) procedures are executed, the actual monitoring data is permanently and irretrievably deleted.\n\n2. Impact of Clearing the Monitoring Database\nClearing the monitoring database impacts only the historical monitoring data (traffic statistics, reports, flow/session logs). It does not affect:\n\n\t* Device configuration settings (VCs, policies, objects, users, licenses, VLANs, etc.)\n\t* Live network operation\u2014data path and optimization functions remain unaffected except for the brief window while services restart\n\nLive monitoring and reporting resumes automatically once the appliance completes the service restart and database rebuild\u2014you do not need to reconfigure reporting or monitoring objects. New monitoring data will be collected starting from the point services are restarted.\n\n3. Alternatives to Full Database Reset\nThere is no officially supported method to partially clean, repair, or selectively preserve historical monitoring data within Exinda. The procedures provided (service restart, then full database clear) are the only remedies for database corruption or persistent rollup failures.\n\n4. Export or Compliance Archiving of Data\nThe only supported method to \u201carchive\u201d or \u201cexport\u201d historical monitoring data for compliance is to:\n\n\t* Use the Web UI to generate and download required summary reports (PDF or CSV) for all relevant periods/objects before proceeding with destructive maintenance.\n\nThe monitoring database itself is not exportable or restorable via CLI, and is not covered by the regular backup process.\n\n5. Performance Implications If Not Cleared\nIf you avoid clearing the monitoring database when it is already corrupted, rollup failures and resource exhaustion will continue to cause blank \"Last 24 Hours\" (and similar) reports. Over time, this may degrade report responsiveness or cause additional system resource warnings, but it will not affect packet forwarding or policies.\n\n6. Automation and Best Practices\nThere are no officially supported scripts or tools for automating the monitoring database reset in production. The commands must be entered manually, exercising extreme care (as documented in the KB article: The Monitoring Database Has Stopped or Become Corrupted [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/117263-the-monitoring-database-has-stopped-or-become-corrupted]).\nRecommended best practices include:\n\n\t* Back up current configuration before any action\n\t* Export essential reports manually as needed\n\t* Schedule downtime to avoid impact to reporting users (Step 2 only erases monitoring data, not configuration or traffic)\n\t* Run service restart commands one-by-one, with sufficient pause between them\n\t* Allow 10\u201315 minutes for new data to begin populating reports after action is complete\n\nFor reference\u2014the step-by-step procedure with risk notes and a demonstration video can be reviewed in the KB article and at this link: https://www.loom.com/share/d343d24f3af44e8196fd6137d67cdcee\n\n\t\tACTION\n\t\tAFFECTED DATA\n\t\tCAN BE RESTORED?\n\t\tMANUAL EXPORT OPTION\n\n\t\tConfiguration backup\n\t\tSystem/VC/Policy config only\n\t\tYes (via backup/restore)\n\t\tNot for monitoring data\n\n\t\tMonitoring database clear\n\t\tAll historical reporting data\n\t\tNo\n\t\tExport PDF/CSV by hand\n\nPlease proceed to export any critical reports you may need before clearing the database, as described above. After the procedure, reporting data will accumulate from scratch and previous monitoring history cannot be restored.\n\nIf there are further questions about the procedure or its effects, more detailed instructions are available in the Knowledge Base:\nThe Monitoring Database Has Stopped or Become Corrupted [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/117263-the-monitoring-database-has-stopped-or-become-corrupted]\n\nBest regards,\nCarlos Encalada\nGFI - Exinda Network Orchestrator Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal. We will write to you again to remind you."

          "Kayako - ticket id 60209095 // Carlos Encalada commented publicly: Dear Sajeedali,\u00a0\n\nThank you for your recent follow-up and for thoroughly documenting the issues experienced with blank subnet and application-wise reports on your Exinda appliance running firmware version v7.6.1 (0143). We have analyzed your latest attachments, including both diagnostics files and PDF/graphical reports, to provide a concrete resolution and address your concerns regarding both process and outcome.\n\nBased on the system logs and the observed behavior, your Exinda appliance is experiencing resource exhaustion in background monitoring processes (notably collectord and datad) after the firmware upgrade. This leads to database rollup failures and blank graphs when generating subnet and application reports, especially over larger time ranges (like \"Last 24 Hours\"), despite traffic being present.\n\nThis scenario and the exact errors are\u00a0covered in Exinda\u2019s official Knowledge Base:\n\n\t* The Monitoring Database Has Stopped or Become Corrupted [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/117263-the-monitoring-database-has-stopped-or-become-corrupted]\n\t* Graphs are not visible in PDF reports for subnets [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120439]\n\n\u00a0\nRecommended Corrective Steps (with Cautionary Notes):\n\n\t* Restart Monitoring Services (non-destructive):\nEnter Exinda CLI and run, pausing for 1\u20132 minutes between each command:\nen\nconf t\nservice jboss restart\nservice datad restart\nservice collector restart\nservice database restart \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0Wait 10\u201315 minutes after completion for graphs to re-populate. This action should not affect live traffic, but may briefly impact reporting/UI response.\u00a0\n\n\t* If the problem persists, reset the monitoring database (destructive):\n\u00a0 \u00a0Warning: This will erase all historical monitoring data. Plan a short maintenance window and back up your configuration beforehand.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Step-by-step procedure:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t* In the CLI, enter restricted shell (using the shell key provided previously if prompted):\n_shell\n\t* Stop the monitoring database and remove current stats:\npm process mysqld terminate\ncd /var/data/monitor\nrm -rf *\nexit \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\t* Reset and restart all major monitoring services (run each and wait in between): \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nconf t\nclear database\npm process mysqld restart\npm process datad restart\npm process collectord restart\npm process monitord restart\npm process jboss restart \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt may take up to 15 minutes for the monitoring databases and graphs to repopulate. Please refer to the official KB for screenshots and deeper technical context: https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/117263-the-monitoring-database-has-stopped-or-become-corrupted\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAdditional Considerations & Professional Practice:\n\n\t* Downtime: Step 2 will temporarily disrupt reporting and will erase all existing monitoring data. Schedule this procedure during a planned outage window. \u00a0\n\t* Backup: Always back up your Exinda configuration before running service restarts or database resets. \u00a0\n\t* Escalation Contacts & Limits: For Exinda on-premises appliances, GFI provides incident resolution through remote diagnosis, published remediation steps, and guidance. Exinda support operates on a shared responsibility model; support cannot directly operate or remotely execute commands on customer appliances. All corrective actions must be applied independently by your team in accordance with our documentation and security controls. \u00a0\n\t* Demonstration Reference: For safe execution, review this short demonstration video (steps applied in a vanilla Exinda test environment):\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/d343d24f3af44e8196fd6137d67cdcee\nWhile the video shows some steps in rapid sequence, in production you should execute commands one at a time to avoid incomplete restarts.\n\t* Post-Procedure Review: Once complete, monitor your reports to verify that \"Last 24 Hours\" and similar time-based graphs now populate as expected where there is actual traffic. \u00a0\n\nLastly, please note that we are unable to participate in a remote troubleshooting session unless all documented steps we have provided have been fully completed and you share detailed evidence of the results. If the recommended actions are not carried out, our ability to assist is limited. Should a remote session become genuinely necessary after all troubleshooting options have been exhausted, we will proactively propose it as the next step. \n\nBest regards,\nCarlos Encalada\nGFI - Exinda Network Orchestrator Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal. We will write to you again to remind you."

We have analyzed the system logs and identified the cause of the reporting issue.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe logs indicate that the `collectord` process is failing to process network traffic due to a buffer overflow error (`No buffer space available`), which often occurs after a firmware upgrade if the monitoring services do not initialize correctly. This prevents data from being aggregated for the \"Last 24 Hours\" reports.\n\n**Resolution:**\nPlease follow the steps from our Knowledge Base article: https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/117263-the-monitoring-database-has-stopped-or-become-corrupted\n\n**Step 1: Restart Services (Non-Destructive)**\nRun the following commands in the Exinda CLI to fully restart the monitoring stack:\n\nen\nconf\u00a0t\nservice\u00a0jboss\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0datad\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0collector\u00a0restart\nservice\u00a0database\u00a0restart\n\nWait 10-15 minutes and check if the graphs begin to populate.\n\n**Step 2: Reset Database (If Step 1 Fails)**\nIf the issue persists, the database format may have been corrupted during the upgrade. You will need to clear the current monitoring data to restore functionality.\n*Warning: This will remove historical monitoring data.*\n\n1. Enter shell mode:\n_shellUse this shell key generated fro your Host ID: \u00a0LK2-RESTRICTED_CMDS-45A0-GK0U-B107-5423-KXA8-6GT6-T56X-2V9J-G089-4GTW-NJPQ-X89C-6\n\n2.

Your screenshot (03/Nov/2025 04:00PM \u2013 07:00PM) is a good example of such a period and shows populated graphs and application-wise breakdowns.\n \t* Check Reporting Settings: Ensure that the \u201cReporting\u201d option is enabled (as indicated by the green checkmark in the Web UI) for all relevant subnets/network objects. This setting must be active before the reporting period for data to be collected.\n \t* Review Filters: Verify that no filters are restricting the dataset (such as by application, host, or traffic type) which might cause a blank result even when some traffic is present.\n \t* Special Characters and Firmware: In your firmware version (v7.6.1), issues with special characters in subnet or object names have already been resolved and do not require further action.\n \t* Understand Reporting Differences [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120671]: Scheduled/PDF reports may differ from the interactive Web UI due to backend reporting differences. For the most accurate, live graphical data, use the Web UI and export the PDF directly from there when needed.\n\nReference Articles:\n\n \t* Graphs are not visible in PDF reports for subnets [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120439]\n \t* Scheduled Reports Look Different Than Some of the Web UI Reporting Graphs [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120671]\n\nConclusion:\nYour Exinda system is operating as designed: when there is traffic during the selected period, subnet and application-wise reports are populated; when there is none, reports will appear blank or show the \u201cData not available for selected period\u201d message. If you are certain there was traffic present for a specific subnet/object and time range but the report still shows no data, ensure that the reporting option was enabled throughout the entire period. Otherwise, this is expected system behavior and does not indicate a product fault.\n\nShould you observe missing data in periods where you can verify traffic activity and reporting was enabled throughout, please provide precise details about the subnet/object and time window for further analysis. For general usage, ensuring your time range and reporting options are correctly set will resolve most blank report scenarios.\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - Exinda Network Orchestrator Support Team."

          "Kayako - ticket id 60209095 // ATLAS commented publicly: Dear Sajeedali,\n\nThank you for providing additional information and screenshots regarding the issue with missing subnet and application-wise reports after your upgrade to firmware version v7.6.1 (0143).\n\nSummary of Analysis:\nBased on your attached screenshots:\n\n \t* For some time ranges (such as \u201cLast 24 Hours\u201d and \u201cLast 10 Minutes\u201d), the subnet and conversation reports display the message \u201cData not available for selected period\u201d, and no data is present in graphs or tables.\n \t* However, when viewing specific time ranges (for example, 03/Nov/2025 04:00PM \u2013 07:00PM), the same network object, \u201cForesight_Driller_9,\u201d shows detailed inbound/outbound data, application separation, and populated graphs with conversation details.\n\nWhat This Indicates:\nThe fact that data is visible for the same network object over certain periods confirms that your device is successfully collecting and displaying monitoring data; the reporting engine and web UI are functioning for both subnet and application views when data exists.\n\nThe \u201cData not available for selected period\u201d message occurs when no traffic has been recorded for the selected subnet or network object during the specified time range. This is a normal behavior in Exinda reporting. It does not indicate a malfunction of the firmware, the reporting mechanism, or a global issue with application recognition.\n\nCommon Scenarios Leading to Blank Reports:\n\n \t* The monitored subnet or network object has no traffic during the selected time period (for example, overnight, maintenance windows, or periods of inactivity).\n \t* Filters may be applied (such as focusing on unclassified traffic or narrowing the time range) that exclude existing data.\n \t* Network objects may have changed definitions, or reporting may be disabled for selected objects (in your screenshots, reporting appears enabled).\n\nRecommendations:\n\n \t* Ensure the Selected Time Range Contains Active Traffic: \nWhen viewing or generating reports, choose a time range where you expect network activity for the subnet or network object. As your screenshots demonstrate, selecting the period 03/Nov/2025 04:00PM \u2013 07:00PM produces valid graphs and application data. \n \t* Review Reporting Configuration: \nVerify that the subnets or network objects you wish to report on have the \u201cReporting\u201d option enabled (indicated by the green checkmark in the Web UI). You have already confirmed this for at least one object in your attachments. \n \t* Special Characters in Subnet/Object Names: \nIn older versions, the presence of special characters in subnet names could disrupt the reports. Since you are on v7.6.1, this issue is resolved, and your objects\u2019 names appear standard, so there is no further action required here. \nReference: Graphs are not visible in PDF reports for subnets [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120439] \n \t* Differences Between Web UI and Scheduled/PDF Reports: \nScheduled reports (or some generated PDFs) might not match the interactive Web UI because of differences in how graphs are generated. For the most accurate, live graphical data, use the interactive Web UI. Manual PDF export from the UI preserves these graphs. More details are available here: \nReference: Scheduled Reports Look Different Than Some of the Web UI Reporting Graphs [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120671] \n\nConclusion:\nYour Exinda device is functioning as expected. The presence of blank graphs for certain periods is due to the absence of data in those specific ranges, not a malfunction of the firmware or system. As long as traffic is present during the chosen time range, subsystem and application-wise reporting should display as intended, as seen in your provided screenshots.\n\nIf you encounter blank data where you know traffic exists (for the selected subnet/object and period), consider verifying that reporting has always been enabled and the object's configuration has not changed during that period. For further analysis, ensure that you always select a time range where active traffic has been recently confirmed.\n\nFor further reference on reporting behavior and troubleshooting steps, you can review the following Exinda knowledge base articles:\n\n \t* Graphs are not visible in PDF reports for subnets [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120439]\n \t* Scheduled Reports Look Different Than Some of the Web UI Reporting Graphs [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120671]\n\nIf your situation differs\u2014for example, if you observe missing data for periods of confirmed activity, or for all subnet objects and all reports\u2014please specify the network object(s) and period(s) affected so we can assist further.\nSincerely,\nAtlas\nGFI - Exinda Network Orchestrator Support Team."

          "Kayako - ticket id 60209095 // ATLAS commented privately: Here is a transcript of the customer's recent interaction with ATLAS chat:\n\n--- Customer (Sajeedali Kazi) ---\n\n v7.6.1 (0143) firmware \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for confirming you\u2019re on firmware v7.6.1 (0143)\u2014that\u2019s a recent version, so the older issues with special characters in subnet names should already be fixed.\n\nLet\u2019s dig a bit deeper so I can help you more effectively:\n\n \t* When you try to generate a subnet report, do you see any error messages, or does the report just not appear at all (e.g., blank, missing graphs, or not downloading)?\n \t* Approximately how many subnets are you including in the report?\n \t* Have you tried waiting for 10\u201315 minutes after starting the report generation, in case it\u2019s just taking a long time?\n \t* Are you generating the report from the Web UI, or is this a scheduled/automated report?\n\nYour answers will help me pinpoint the cause and suggest the best next steps! \n\n--- Customer (Sajeedali Kazi) ---\n\n its a blank graph \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for clarifying\u2014the report generates, but the subnet graph is blank. That helps narrow things down!\n\nBased on your firmware version (v7.6.1), the most common causes for blank subnet graphs are:\n\n \t* Subnet Names with Special Characters:\n\nWhile this was mostly fixed in earlier updates, sometimes special characters (like , !, /, &, (, etc.) in subnet names can still cause issues.\n- Could you check if any of your subnet names contain special characters? If so, try renaming them to use only letters, numbers, dashes, or underscores, then regenerate the report.\n\n \t* Large Number of Subnets:\n\nIf you have hundreds of subnets, the report can take a long time to generate, and sometimes graphs may not render if the system times out or runs into resource limits.\n- About how many subnets are you reporting on?\n\n \t* Data Availability:\n\nIf there\u2019s no traffic or data for the selected subnet(s) during the report\u2019s time range, the graph may appear blank.\n- Are you sure there\u2019s traffic/activity for the subnets in the selected time period?\n\nHere\u2019s what I recommend trying next:\n\n \t* Check and, if needed, rename any subnets with special characters.\n \t* Try generating a report for just one or two subnets to see if the graph appears.\n \t* Make sure you\u2019re selecting a time range where you know there was network activity.\n\nLet me know what you find after these checks! If the issue persists, I\u2019ll guide you through the next steps. \n\n--- Customer (Sajeedali Kazi) ---\n\n on all the subnets we are facing this issue \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for letting me know that the issue is happening on all subnets, not just a few. That definitely rules out some of the more isolated causes.\n\nLet\u2019s try to pinpoint the problem a bit further:\n\n \t* Are you able to see any other types of graphs or reports (for example, application or interface reports), or is it only the subnet graphs that are blank?\n \t* Have you recently made any changes to your network configuration, subnet definitions, or reporting settings?\n \t* When you view subnet data in the Exinda Web UI (outside of the PDF report), do you see live or historical data for those subnets, or is it blank there as well?\n \t* Are you generating the report for a custom time range, or using the default (last 24 hours, last week, etc.)?\n\nThese details will help me determine if the issue is with the reporting engine, data collection, or something else. Once I have your answers, I\u2019ll suggest the next best steps! \n\n--- Customer (Sajeedali Kazi) ---\n\n also we are not geeting application wise details \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for sharing that you\u2019re not seeing application-wise details either\u2014so both subnet and application graphs are blank in your reports. This points to a broader issue with report generation or data collection.\n\nHere\u2019s what I found from our knowledge base that matches your situation:\n\n \t* This can sometimes happen if the Exinda appliance is experiencing high memory usage, which causes the PDF report generation to fail or skip certain sections. Even if interface graphs show up, application and subnet details may be missing.\n \t* The recommended first step is to perform a planned reboot of your Exinda appliance. This helps clear up memory and can often resolve the issue.\n \t* After rebooting, try generating the report again to see if the graphs and application details appear.\n\nIf the problem persists after a reboot, the next steps are:\n\n \t* Generate a packet capture (TCP dump) from your Exinda appliance.\n \t* Create a system diagnostics file (sysdump) from Configuration > System Diagnostics > Diagnostics.\n \t* Save a copy of the blank PDF report.\n\nYou can find more details in these articles:\n\n \t* Subnets PDF Monitor Report is Blank [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/118226] \n \t* Graphs are not visible in PDF reports for subnets [https://support.exinda.gfi.com/article/120439] \n\nWould you like step-by-step instructions for any of these actions? And just to confirm, have you already tried rebooting the appliance since this issue started? \n\n--- Customer (Sajeedali Kazi) ---\n\n please log a ticket for the same \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for letting me know! \ud83d\ude0a A human colleague will be happy to assist you further\u2014please feel free to choose from the available options to connect with them. \n\n--- Customer (Sajeedali Kazi) ---\n\n Button selection: [\ud83d\udce9 Raise a ticket] \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Please provide any other additional details we might need to investigate and resolve your issue.\n\nYou can use Shift+Enter if you want to continue typing in a new line.\n\nFor now, I am unable to take any file uploads, so any relevant log files or attachments can be provided directly in the ticket once I create it for you.\n\n Please note: the ticket will get created only after you provide the above requested information or after a 5-minute timeout. \n\n--- Customer (Sajeedali Kazi) ---\n\n provide directly \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n If you want to add additional \ud83d\udce7 email addresses in the ticket CC, please specify them below.\n\nYou can specify multiple email addresses, separated by a comma (for example: test@example.com, test2@example.com)\n\nOtherwise, just click the button \ud83d\udc47 \n"
