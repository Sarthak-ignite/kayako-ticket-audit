We have defined a special rule because our pharmacies need to access the Austrian health network via a route. You have to imagine that in the pharmacy there are card readers that communicate directly with the health network, because the customers\u2019 prescriptions are retrieved via a chip card (E-Card).\n\nThese card readers are located in the pharmacy\u2019s local network and must access the health network through a route to their dedicated router. The response from this router may only return via NAT to a specific address (the address of the Kerio firewall). We solved this using a route and a dedicated traffic rule.\n\nOn the NG120, when we disable the traffic rule, routing works, but the card readers \u2013 logically \u2013 receive no response. When we enable the traffic rule, the routing itself stops working. \n\nAttached are two images for illustration. \n\nimage \nimage \nimage \n \u00a0 "

This new setup requires a unique rule which seems to influence routing, and we intend to support you in resolving it within that dedicated ticket.\n\nAs the device is now functioning correctly, we will close this initial ticket related to the boot/UUID issue.

Diagnostics/log collection were not feasible prior to recovery due to non-booting state.\n11. - Warranty/RMA context: Warranty was indicated by distributor. Approver advised not to proceed with RMA because build 10:9072 resolves the issue. Per workflow, we did not disclose RMA denial to the customer; we focused on delivering the correct image and recovery steps.\n12. - Outcome: Customer confirmed \u201cAfter the rescue image the hardware runs now stable.\u201d The original boot issue is resolved.\n13. - Follow-up: Customer reported a new routing/NAT behavior issue after recovery. To avoid mixing topics, we split this into a new ticket (ID: 60246394) dedicated to the traffic rule/NAT routing to the Austrian health network.\n14. - Criteria/Reasoning: All required info was present; known software/build remediation succeeded; no further RMA action needed.

This build addresses the UUID boot issue seen on some early NG120 units. You can follow the steps outlined in this guide on restoring the Kerio Control Box NG series to its default configuration [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/119660] to create a USB and execute a complete recovery.\n\nImportant:\n- Ensure that the image you use is the NG120 rescue image build 10:9072. If the website still does not provide build 10:9072, please refrain from proceeding and we will supply you with the correct package through this ticket.\n- After completing the recovery process, remove the USB, reboot your system, and inform us of the outcome.\n- Should the recovery still be unsuccessful, kindly share a short video of the attempt, including both the screen and front LEDs, to help us analyze the situation and provide assistance promptly.\n\nWe are also preparing to deliver the 10:9072 rescue image package directly through this ticket to facilitate this process for you.\n\nBest regards,\nCentral Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.

Therefore, proceeding with targeted system recovery instructions using build 10:9072 instead of RMA at this stage. 4) Warranty/RMA: Warranty indication already received via distributor; however, RMA was not approved by approver due to the known fix in build 10:9072.

I understand you need an RMA for your Kerio NG120 hardware box. Before I connect you with our support team to create the ticket, I need to gather some important information that will help speed up the process.\n\nAccording to our RMA process [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120394], there are a few prerequisites and details we'll need:\n\nFirst, a couple of quick questions:\n\n \t* What specific issue are you experiencing with the NG120? (For example: won't power on, LED lights off, network performance issues, boot problems, etc.)\n\n \t* Have you already tried a factory reset or system recovery on the box? This is typically required before an RMA can be processed.\n\nAlso, for the RMA request, we'll need:\n\n \t* A video showing the physical problem or unexpected behavior (this is required)\n \t* Serial Number (located on the back of the device)\n \t* Diagnostic logs if the box is still accessible\n \t* Your shipping details (company name, contact info, shipping address)\n\nCould you start by telling me what symptoms you're seeing with the hardware? \n\n--- Customer (Maislinger Robert) ---\n\n The firewall dosent boot i get a error message from ubuntu \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Got it - the NG120 won't boot and you're seeing an Ubuntu error message. That's definitely concerning since it's preventing the firewall from starting up.\n\nCan you tell me what the specific Ubuntu error message says? Even a partial message or photo would be really helpful. This will help determine if there's a potential fix we can try before proceeding with the RMA.\n\nAlso, have you attempted any of these recovery steps yet?\n\n \t* Factory reset of the box\n \t* System recovery using the kerio-control-rescue image\n\nAccording to the RMA process [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120394], attempting a factory reset and complete system recovery is required before an RMA can be issued. If you haven't tried these yet, we might be able to get your firewall back up and running without needing a replacement.\n\nWhat does the error message say exactly? \n\n--- Customer (Maislinger Robert) ---\n\n Sarting Kerio OS... Wating for UUID=... findfs: unable to resolve 'UUID=' Debug log duped to file /blkid-dbug.txt ALERT! 'UUID=' does not exist. Dropping to a shell! / # \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thank you for providing that error message! That's a critical boot failure - the system can't find the UUID of the boot partition, which typically indicates a corrupted file system or failed storage.\n\nThis is definitely a serious hardware issue. Before we proceed with the RMA, according to the RMA process requirements [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120394], you'll need to attempt a complete system recovery using the kerio-control-rescue image. This is the last troubleshooting step required before an RMA can be approved.\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\nSystem Recovery Process:\n\n \t* Download the kerio-control-rescue image for your NG120\n \t* Create a bootable USB flash drive with the rescue image\n \t* Boot the NG120 from the USB to perform complete system recovery\n\nYou can find the detailed instructions here: Restoring the Kerio Control Box NG series default configuration [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/119660]\n\nHave you already attempted this system recovery step? If yes, and it still failed, then we can proceed with gathering all the RMA information and I'll connect you with our support team to create the ticket.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, this is required before the RMA can be processed. Let me know if you need help with the recovery process or if you've already tried it! \n\n--- Customer (Maislinger Robert) ---\n\n We aleready tried it and it dosent work \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Understood - if the system recovery didn't work, then we definitely need to proceed with the RMA. I'll gather all the required information and then connect you with our support team to create the ticket.\n\nAccording to the RMA requirements [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120394], here's what we need:\n\nRequired Information:\n\n \t* Serial Number (located on the back of the NG120)\n \t* Video showing the boot failure with the UUID error (this is mandatory for RMA approval)\n \t* Company and Shipping Details:\n\n- Company name\n- Contact name\n- Contact phone number\n- Contact email address\n- Full shipping address (Street, Zip Code, City, Country)\n\nWe already have:\n\n \t* License key: 20339-1LQWD-4A2PV\n \t* Issue description: Boot failure with UUID error, system recovery attempted but failed\n\nCould you please provide:\n\n \t* The serial number from the back of the NG120\n \t* Your company name and full shipping address\n \t* Contact phone number\n\nAlso, do you have a video or can you record a short video showing the boot process with the UUID error message? You can upload it using the secure file upload portal I mentioned earlier. \n\n--- Customer (Maislinger Robert) ---\n\n Serial Number: 2536BA0172 \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Perfect, thank you! I have the serial number: 2536BA0172\n\nNow I still need a few more details to complete the RMA request:\n\nStill Required:\n\n \t* Company name\n \t* Contact name (your name)\n \t* Contact phone number\n \t* Full shipping address (Street address, Zip Code, City, Country)\n \t* Video of the boot failure - This is mandatory for RMA approval.
