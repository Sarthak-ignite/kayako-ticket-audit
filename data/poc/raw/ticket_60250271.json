We sincerely apologize for the experience you had when attempting to raise a ticket. \n\n In the meantime, the best way to do this would be to access the support portal (https://khoros-care.kayako.com/\u00a0or https://khoros-marketing.kayako.com/ [https://khoros-marketing.kayako.com/%20]) outside of your corporate network/browser to be able to see the Chat option. \n\n That being said, based on your detailed explanation, I have a theory on what might have caused this, so let's test it: \n\n \t* I have made a tiny change on our side now for your account. I believe if you try to log in to Marketing now, it should work.\n\t* If logging to Marketing works now, please log out. Then, log in to Care, and log out.\n\t* Attempt to log in to Marketing again, it should fail again.\n\n Please let me know once you complete the above. I will do a temporary fix again to allow you to log in to Marketing again, and we will work on a permanent fix for this. The results of the above test will confirm the theory. \n\n I remain at your disposal. \n\nBest regards,\nPavly Nashed\nKhoros Marketing Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.

We sincerely apologize for the experience you had when attempting to raise a ticket.\n\nIn the meantime, the best way to do this would be to access the support portal (https://khoros-care.kayako.com/ or https://khoros-marketing.kayako.com/) outside of your corporate network/browser to be able to see the Chat option.\n\nThat being said, based on your detailed explanation, I have a theory on what might have caused this, so let's test it:\n\n\t* I have made a tiny change on our side now for your account. I believe if you try to log in to Marketing now, it should work.\n\t* If logging to Marketing works now, please log out. Then, log in to Care, and log out.\n\t* Attempt to log in to Marketing again, it should fail again.\n\nPlease let me know once you complete the above. I will do a temporary fix again to allow you to log in to Marketing again, and we will work on a permanent fix for this. The results of the above test will confirm the theory.\n\nI remain at your disposal.\nBest regards,\nPavly Nashed\nKhoros Marketing Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.

But my current suspicion is with the Brand Key misdirecting to Care IF the customer's last access was to Care because the Unified Access still has traces of this and both are linked to the same Brand Key. \n Based on this, when I impersonate a customer, the last accessed is Marketing and the issue is resolved for them until they log in back to Care. \n\n Let's test this suspicion.\u00a0 "

Erika explained to me that it is not possible anymore, so we need to have different links to Care and Marketing. I got that. I \n\u00a0finally can access to Care, then when I tried to access to Khoros Marketing (other link, incognito user, etc) it failed, the tool gave me the message with \u201cthere has been an error with login\u201d. And it says that you can write to a support mail, apparently this mail it is not working anymore, and it sent me to \u201cKhoros help center\u201d. I finally access to this help center without receiving\u00a0any help, because the chat bot is not available. So, this is the summery of the case.\u00a0 \nI have tried to access again two minutes ago.

For example, switching networks, using a different browser, or adjusting any local system settings.\n\nBased on the history of the previous tickets, Briamel also gained access to Care, but this should not impact their login unless they are attempting to use SSO or using the wrong login URL. The correct URL remains:\nhttps://login.app.khoros.com/user/login?forceLogin=true\n\nTo be clear: we did not apply any fix on our end during the last incident. The issue was resolved solely due to adjustments made by Briamel on their side, likely including network-related changes.\n\nAt this point, we need more information about any recent modifications on their environment so we can proceed with deeper investigation. Reviewing the current behavior, it appears identical to what we saw before the previous fix\u2014meaning Briamel may need to reapply the same changes that resolved the issue previously.\n\nPlease provide details on any updates or changes made on their side since the last resolution.\n\nBest regards,\nPavly Nashed\nKhoros Marketing Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.
