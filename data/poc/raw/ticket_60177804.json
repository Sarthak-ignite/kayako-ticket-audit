We\u2019ve reviewed them and identified several factors contributing to the intermittent \u201cfreeze\u201d where mail stops until you restart the server.\n\nWhat we found\n\n\t* POP3 download authentication failures: Multiple remote accounts are repeatedly failing to authenticate against mail.caio.com.br:995 [http://mail.caio.com.br:995/], which triggers continuous retries and load.\n\t* File locking by antivirus/backup: Temporary antivirus files in the Kerio store cannot be removed because they\u2019re held by another process, which is typical of real-time AV or backup scanning the mailstore.\n\t* Full-Text Search service timeouts: The fulltext process is timing out shortly after start, which can stall components and add CPU load.\n\t* Corrupted queue envelopes: Some .env files in the message queue are invalid and block normal processing.\n\t* Ongoing mailbox index repairs: Many folders are being auto-recovered from index logs, adding extra I/O during operation.\n\nAction plan to stabilize\n\n\t* POP3 download cleanup\n\n\t* In Administration Console, go to Configuration > Delivery > POP3 Download and:\n\n\t* Correct invalid credentials or disable failing accounts temporarily (we see several failures against mail.caio.com.br [http://mail.caio.com.br/]).\n\t* If any accounts are set to \u201cleave messages on server\u201d but the provider doesn\u2019t support UIDL, uncheck that option for those accounts.\n\t* Use \u201cDownload Now\u201d on a corrected account to confirm successful retrieval.\n\n\t* Exclude Kerio from antivirus/backup scanning\n\n\t* Configure your AV/backup to exclude the Kerio installation and the entire store, including tmp and queue. Based on your paths, exclude:\n\n\t* C:\\Program Files\\Kerio\\MailServer\\\n\t* E:\\Kerio\\MailServer\\store\\\n\t* E:\\Kerio\\MailServer\\store\\tmp\\\n\t* E:\\Kerio\\MailServer\\store\\queue\\\n\t* E:\\Kerio\\MailServer\\store\\archive\\\n\t* E:\\Kerio\\MailServer\\store\\backup\\\n\n\t* If possible, temporarily pause real-time scanning to validate improvement, then re-enable with the exclusions in place.\n\n\t* Full\u2011Text Search (FTS) triage\n\n\t* Short term: disable FTS in Configuration > Advanced Options > Store Directory > Full\u2011Text Search to remove the timeout from the equation.\n\t* After the system is stable, please re-enable FTS and rebuild the fulltext index in a maintenance window.\n\n\t* Clear corrupted queue envelopes\n\n\t* Stop the Kerio Connect service.\n\n\t* Back up the queue folder:\n\n\t* E:\\Kerio\\MailServer\\store\\queue\n\n\t* Remove only the specific corrupted .env files referenced in the logs (do not delete .eml files).\n\t* Start the Kerio Connect service and confirm that the queue processes normally.\n\n\t* Finish mailbox index repairs\n\n\t* In Admin Console, go to Accounts > Users, select impacted users, and run More Actions > Reindex Mailbox. This lets Kerio complete the index work cleanly and reduces repeated I/O.\n\nPlease let us know if the issue persists.\n\nReferences\n\n\t* Antivirus Exclusions for Kerio Connect [https://support.kerioconnect.gfi.com/article/115965]\n\t* Full Text Search Is Crashing with Timeout Errors [https://support.kerioconnect.gfi.com/article/114805]\n\t* Troubleshooting Full Text Search Functionality Issues in Kerio Connect [https://support.kerioconnect.gfi.com/article/114129]\n\t* Fixing Data Consistency Issues [https://support.kerioconnect.gfi.com/article/114336]\n\t* Configuring POP3 for Remote Emails and Applying Sorting Rules in Kerio Connect [https://support.kerioconnect.gfi.com/article/115891]\n\t* Error: \u201cEmpty envelope file\u201d in the Log File on MacOS/Linux [https://support.kerioconnect.gfi.com/article/112611]\n\t* Starting or Stopping the Kerio Connect Server on Windows [https://support.kerioconnect.gfi.com/article/114508]\n\nBest regards,\nArafat Bakhsh\nGFI - Kerio Connect Support Team\n\nThis ticket will stay open for one week unless you reply with \"This ticket can be closed\" or update the status to Completed in the portal.

After reviewing them, we\u2019ve identified several factors that are causing your Kerio Connect server to freeze and stop processing email until a full restart: \n\n \t* POP3 Authentication Failures \u2013 Multiple accounts are repeatedly failing login against mail.caio.com.br. These endless retries overload the server.\n \t* File Locking by Antivirus/Backup \u2013 Temp and queue files are being locked by another process, preventing Kerio from cleaning up its store. This is typically caused by real-time antivirus or backup agents.\n \t* FullText Indexing Service Crashes \u2013 The full-text search process is timing out, which stalls the mailserver and contributes to CPU spikes.\n \t* Corrupted Queue Files \u2013 Some .env files in the queue are invalid and block message delivery.\n\n Recommended Actions: \n\n \t* Audit all POP3 accounts in Configuration \u2192 POP3 Download and correct or remove those with bad credentials.\n \t* Exclude the entire Kerio store path (E:\\Kerio\\MailServer\\store) from real-time antivirus and backup processes, especially the tmp/ and queue/ folders.\n \t* Temporarily disable FullText indexing under Advanced Options \u2192 Full-Text Search. Rebuild later once stability is restored.\n \t* Stop Kerio, back up E:\\Kerio\\MailServer\\store\\queue, then remove the corrupted .env files mentioned in the logs before restarting the service.\n \t* On VMware, ensure the VM has reserved CPU and increase memory allocation to at least 16\u201320 GB if possible.\n\n These steps should significantly reduce the freezes and restore stable mail flow. Please let us know once you\u2019ve applied them, or if you\u2019d like us to provide the exact antivirus/backup exclusion list. \n Best regards, \n Daniel Bosman \n Support Team \n\n =============================================================== \n\nADDITIONAL CONTEXT?\n\n N/A \n\n =============================================================== \n GPT \n Did you use GPT: Yes "
