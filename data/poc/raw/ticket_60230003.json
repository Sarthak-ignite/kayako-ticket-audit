Let me dig a bit deeper into this connection issue.</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>Perfect! I found a specific article that addresses exactly this error. There's a known issue with the SpamTag installer failing to verify the URL even when the server is reachable.</p>\n      <p>Here's what we need to check and try:</p>\n      <h2>Troubleshooting Steps:</h2>\n      <p><strong>1. Check the Exact URL Format</strong><br>\n      When you're entering the URL in the installer, what format are you using? It should be:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><code>http://servername</code> or <code>http://servername:port</code> (if using a custom port)</li>\n        <li><code>https://servername</code> or <code>https://servername:port</code> (if using SSL)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Don't include any trailing slashes or additional paths.</p>\n      <p><strong>2. SSL Certificate Issue (if using HTTPS)</strong><br>\n      If you're trying to use HTTPS, the installer requires a <strong>valid HTTPS certificate</strong>. If you're using a self-signed certificate or there are certificate issues, this will cause the verification to fail.</p>\n      <p><strong>3. Check the Installer Log</strong><br>\n      The installer creates a detailed log that can tell us exactly what's failing. Can you check this log file?</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Location: <code>%temp%\\gfioutlookinstall_DATE.log</code></li>\n        <li>To get there quickly: Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong>, type <code>%temp%</code> and press Enter</li>\n        <li>Look for the most recent <code>gfioutlookinstall_*.log</code> file</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><strong>A few quick questions:</strong></p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <strong>What exact URL are you entering</strong> in the installer? (e.g., <a href=\"http://mailserver\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mailserver</a> or <a href=\"https://mail.domain.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mail.domain.com</a>)\n        </li>\n        <li><strong>Are you using a custom port</strong> for MailEssentials?</li>\n        <li><strong>If using HTTPS, do you have a valid SSL certificate</strong> installed (not self-signed)?</li>\n        <li><strong>Can you open the installer log</strong> and share any error messages you see?</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>The full article with more details is here: <a href=\"https://support.mailessentials.gfi.com/article/120087\" rel=\"nofollow\">Error: 'The installer failed to verify the URL' When Installing Spamtag</a></p>\n      <p>Let me know what you find, and we'll get this sorted out! \ud83d\udd0d</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Mike Willard) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <a href=\"http://exch2019/MailEssentials/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://exch2019/MailEssentials/</a> this is what the installer enters itself. 2 No custom port.\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- AI Assistant ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>Ah, I see the issue! The installer is auto-populating the URL with a trailing path <code>/MailEssentials/</code> which is likely causing the verification to fail.</p>\n      <p><strong>Try this:</strong></p>\n      <p>When the installer auto-fills <code>http://exch2019/MailEssentials/</code>, you need to <strong>manually edit it</strong> to remove the trailing path. Change it to just:</p>\n      <pre><code>http://exch2019\n</code></pre>\n      <p>The installer only needs the base server URL without any additional paths or trailing slashes.</p>\n      <p><strong>Quick test before reinstalling:</strong></p>\n      <p>Can you open a browser on that PC and confirm that <code>http://exch2019</code> (without the /MailEssentials/ part) is accessible and redirects or responds properly?</p>\n      <p>Also, since we're troubleshooting this, it would be really helpful to check that installer log I mentioned:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong>, type <code>%temp%</code> and hit Enter</li>\n        <li>Look for the most recent file named <code>gfioutlookinstall_*.log</code></li>\n        <li>Open it with Notepad and look for any error messages near the bottom</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><strong>Once you have that:</strong></p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Try the SpamTag installer again using just <code>http://exch2019</code> as the URL</li>\n        <li>Let me know if it successfully verifies this time, or if you get a different error</li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>What happens when you try with the shortened URL? \ud83e\udd14</p>\n    </div><br>\n    <p><strong>--- Customer (Mike Willard) ---</strong></p>\n    <div>\n      <p>Error.<br>\n      at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetResponse()<br>\n      at System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpChannelFactory`1.HttpRequestChannel.HttpChannelRequest.WaitForReply(TimeSpan timeout)<br>\n      --- End of inner exception stack trace ---</p>\n      <p>Server stack trace:<br>\n      at System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpChannelUtilities.ValidateRequestReplyResponse(HttpWebRequest request, HttpWebResponse response, HttpChannelFactory<code>1 factory, WebException responseException, ChannelBinding channelBinding) at System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpChannelFactory</code>1.HttpRequestChannel.HttpChannelRequest.WaitForReply(TimeSpan timeout)<br>\n      at System.ServiceModel.Channels.RequestChannel.Request(Message message, TimeSpan timeout)<br>\n      at System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.RequestChannelBinder.Request(Message message, TimeSpan timeout)<br>\n      at System.ServiceModel.Channels.ServiceChannel.Call(String action, Boolean oneway, ProxyOperationRuntime operation, Object[] ins, Object[] outs, TimeSpan timeout)<br>\n      at System.ServiceModel.Channels.ServiceChannelProxy.InvokeService(IMethodCallMessage methodCall, ProxyOperationRuntime operation)<br>\n      at System.ServiceModel.Channels.ServiceChannelProxy.Invoke(IMessage message)</p>\n      <p>Exception rethrown at [0]:<br>\n      at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.HandleReturnMessage(IMessage reqMsg, IMessage retMsg)<br>\n      at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.PrivateInvoke(MessageData& msgData, Int32 type)<br>\n      at MEC.Configuration.Base.IClientAccessVersionService.GetServiceVersion()<br>\n      at MailEssentials.Installer.Bootstrapper.OutlookPlugin.ViewModels.InstallConfigViewModel.<.ctor>b__14_0(Object sender, DoWorkEventArgs args)<br>\n      [4B80:170C][2025-10-27T15:18:38]i000: Validating URL <<<br>\n      [4B80:466C][2025-10-27T15:21:11]i000: Starting validation worker ...<br>\n      [4B80:466C][2025-10-27T15:21:11]i000: Starting validation worker ... ok<br>\n      [4B80:1728][2025-10-27T15:21:11]i000: Validating URL >><br>\n      [4B80:1728][2025-10-27T15:21:11]i000: Client Access Version URI: <a href=\"http://exch2019_Services/clientaccessversionservice.svc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://exch2019_Services/clientaccessversionservice.svc</a><br>\n      [4B80:1728][2025-10-27T15:21:12]e000: Failed to validate URL: System.ServiceModel.EndpointNotFoundException: There was no endpoint listening at <a href=\"http://exch2019_services/clientaccessversionservice.svc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://exch2019_services/clientaccessversionservice.svc</a> that could accept the message.
