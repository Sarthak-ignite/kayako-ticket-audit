          "GHI Engineering - 15431 // trilogy-taro[bot] commented: ## Engineering Issue Bot\n\n### Resolution Summary\n\nI have successfully upgraded the Apache HTTP Server component in the GFI LanGuard agent from version **2.4.62** to **2.4.65**, addressing the security vulnerability reported in this issue.\n\n### Issue Reproduction\n\nThe issue reported that the GFI LanGuard agent component was using Apache version 2.4.62 while the latest available version was 2.4.65. This discrepancy posed a security risk as outdated versions may contain known vulnerabilities that have been addressed in newer releases.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Investigation findings:**\n- **Repository**: trilogy-group/gfi-languard\n- **Current state**: The main branch previously contained Apache 2.4.62 (upgraded in February 2025 via PR #3287)\n- **Issue**: Apache 2.4.62 is not the latest version; 2.4.65 was released on July 24, 2025\n- **Location**: Apache binaries are stored in `Files - Agent/Httpd/` directory and packaged into the LanGuard agent installer\n- **Build process**: Apache binaries are obtained from Apache Lounge (https://www.apachelounge.com/), a trusted source for Windows Apache binaries\n\nThe outdated version would be detected by security scanners as a vulnerability, which could impact compliance and security posture.\n\n### Fix Implementation\n\n**Changes made:**\n1. Downloaded Apache 2.4.65 Win64 binaries from Apache Lounge (VS17 build)\n2. Updated all Apache executables, DLLs, and modules in the `Files - Agent/Httpd/` directory\n3. Updated OpenSSL to version 3.5.1 (bundled with Apache 2.4.65)\n4. Added new libraries and modules that come with Apache 2.4.65:\n   - New DLLs: brotlicommon.dll, brotlienc.dll, jansson.dll, libcrypto-3-x64.dll, libssl-3-x64.dll, libcurl.dll, lua54.dll, pcre2-8.dll\n   - New modules: mod_charset_lite.so, mod_proxy_uwsgi.so\n5. Updated Apache documentation files (ABOUT_APACHE.txt, LICENSE.txt, NOTICE.txt, README.txt, CHANGES.txt, INSTALL.txt)\n\n**Change characteristics:**\n- **Minimal code changes**: Only binary files and documentation updated\n- **Low risk**: Following established upgrade pattern (similar to previous Apache upgrades in PR #3287, #3098, #2832, #2511, #2419)\n- **Coding style**: No code style changes required (binary-only update)\n\n### Test Plan\n\n**Testing requirements:**\n1. **Unit tests**: No new unit tests required (binary-only update)\n2. **Integration tests**:\n   - Verify LanGuard agent service starts successfully\n   - Confirm Apache HTTP server initializes correctly\n   - Test HTTP/HTTPS connectivity to agent\n   - Verify all Apache modules load without errors\n3. **E2E tests**:\n   - Deploy updated agent in test environment\n   - Run security scan using GFI LanGuard or external scanner\n   - Verify Apache version is detected as 2.4.65\n   - Test full agent functionality (scanning, reporting, patch management)\n4. **Impact analysis**:\n   - Affected component: GFI LanGuard Agent only\n   - No changes to core LanGuard server or scanning engines\n   - No database schema changes\n   - No API changes\n5. **Regression testing**:\n   - Test agent deployment and upgrade scenarios\n   - Verify agent-to-server communication\n   - Test WAN agent connectivity\n\n### Test Results\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Tests not yet executed** - This requires building the installer and deploying in a test environment. The changes have been committed and a pull request has been created for review and testing by the development team.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n\u2705 **Pull Request Created**: [#3499](https://github.com/trilogy-group/gfi-languard/pull/3499)\n- Branch: `issue-bot/apache-2.4.65-upgrade`\n- Status: Draft (ready for review and testing)\n- Changes: 149 files updated (all Apache binaries and modules)\n\n**Testing recommendations:**\n1. Build the LanGuard agent installer with the updated Apache binaries\n2. Deploy to a test environment (preferably matching customer configuration)\n3. Run comprehensive functional tests\n4. Perform security scan to verify Apache 2.4.65 is detected\n5. Monitor for any errors or warnings in agent logs\n\n### Verdict\n\n**Confidence Level**: 85% likely correct\n\n**Rationale:**\n- \u2705 The upgrade follows the same pattern as previous successful Apache upgrades (PR #3287, #3098, #2832, etc.)\n- \u2705 Binaries obtained from trusted source (Apache Lounge) - same source used in previous upgrades\n- \u2705 All required files updated (executables, DLLs, modules, documentation)\n- \u2705 OpenSSL also updated to latest version (3.5.1)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Binary-only update means no build-time issues, but runtime testing required\n- \u26a0\ufe0f New libraries and modules added - need to verify compatibility\n\n**Alternative solutions considered:**\n1. **Build Apache from source** (0% confidence - not practical)\n   - Would require setting up complex build environment\n   - Apache Lounge binaries are pre-compiled and widely used\n   - Previous upgrades used pre-built binaries\n2. **Update to Apache 2.4.64 instead** (50% confidence - not optimal)\n   - Would still not address the gap to latest version\n   - 2.4.65 is the current latest stable release\n\n### Next Steps for Completion\n\n1. **Review**: Development team should review PR #3499\n2. **Build**: Build the LanGuard agent installer with updated Apache\n3. **Test**: Execute the test plan outlined above\n4. **Deploy**: If tests pass, merge PR and include in next release\n5. **Verify**: After deployment, confirm security scanners detect Apache 2.4.65\n\nThe solution is ready for testing and deployment. Once verified, this will fully resolve the security vulnerability reported in this issue."

This component is currently outdated as we are running Apache version 2.4.62. The latest version of Apache is 2.4.65.\n\nIf a different scanner or GFI Langard will scan itself or the deployments where the GFI Langard agent is deployed, it will basically flag that it's causing the vulnerability. This is a high security concern and we need to fix this as soon as possible.\n\nFor your reference I am adding the Apache changelog and also what is fixed and what kind of vulnerabilities are fixed in the latest version. https://httpd.apache.org/\u00a0\n\n"
