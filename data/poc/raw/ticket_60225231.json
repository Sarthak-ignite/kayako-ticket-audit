Let me gather some information to help troubleshoot this. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Could you tell me a bit more about what's happening with your license registration? This will help me get you the right solution quickly:\n\n \t* What specific error message are you seeing when trying to register the license?\n \t* Are you using a hardware box (like NG100, NG300, NG500) or a software/virtual appliance?\n \t* How are you trying to register - online through the admin interface, or offline with a license.key file?\n \t* Have you tried any troubleshooting steps already?\n\nBased on what I found, there are a few common scenarios for license registration issues:\n\n \t* Hardware boxes not accepting license keys - This can happen if there's incorrect information in the license file\n \t* License is not for this hardware error - This occurs when there's a mismatch between the hardware and the license file\n \t* Offline registration issues - Sometimes the automatic registration doesn't work and you need to manually download and import the license file\n\nLet me know these details and I'll guide you through the right solution! \ud83d\udd27 \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n appliance has not valid license \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for that info! Let me help you get your appliance properly licensed. To give you the most accurate solution, I need a few more details:\n\n \t* What type of appliance do you have?\n\n- Hardware box (NG100, NG300, NG500, etc.)\n- Software/Virtual appliance (VMware, Hyper-V, ISO installation)\n\n \t* Do you have a license key? If yes, what happens when you try to register it?\n\n \t* What message are you seeing exactly? For example:\n\n- There is no valid license for the product\n- License expired\n- An error when trying to import the license\n- Something else?\n\n \t* Can your Kerio Control appliance access the internet? This affects whether we can do online or offline registration.\n\nIn the meantime, here's what typically needs to happen to register Kerio Control:\n\nIf you have internet access:\n\n \t* You can register directly through the Kerio Control admin interface using your license number\n\nIf you don't have internet access:\n\n \t* You'll need to download the license.key file from the Kerio Product Registration page [https://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control] and import it manually \n\nLet me know those details and I'll walk you through the exact steps to get your license activated! \ud83d\udccb \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n software appliance with legal key license \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Perfect! So you have a software appliance with a valid license key, but it's showing as not having a valid license. Let me help you get this sorted out. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Great! Let's get your software appliance licensed. Since you have a legal license key, here are the steps to register it:\n\nOPTION 1: ONLINE REGISTRATION (IF YOUR APPLIANCE HAS INTERNET ACCESS)\n\n \t* Open the Kerio Control administration interface\n \t* On the Dashboard, click Configuration Assistant\n \t* Click Register product\n \t* Select License\n \t* Choose Enter license\n \t* Insert your license code\n \t* Review the license details for correctness\n \t* Enter your personal and organization details and agree with the Privacy Policy\n \t* Click Next and follow the wizard\n\nThe license should be activated automatically within a few minutes. \n-------------------------\n\nOPTION 2: OFFLINE REGISTRATION (IF NO INTERNET ACCESS OR ONLINE METHOD FAILS)\n\n \t* Go to the Kerio Product Registration page [https://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control] \n \t* Register using your purchased license number\n \t* Download the license.key file\n \t* Import it into Kerio Control:\n\n- Open the administration interface\n- On the Dashboard, click Configuration Assistant\n- Click Register product\n- Click Register offline by license file\n- Import the license file you downloaded\n- Click Next and follow the wizard \n-------------------------\n Quick questions to help troubleshoot:\n\n \t* Have you tried registering the license already? If so, what error message did you see?\n \t* Does your Kerio Control appliance have internet access?\n\nLet me know how it goes or if you encounter any errors during the process! \ud83d\udd11 \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n it show me only error license or verification key \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Okay, so you're getting an error about license or verification key when trying to register. This is frustrating, but let's figure out what's happening. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I see what's happening. This error typically occurs when there's an issue with the license file information or a mismatch between the license and your appliance. Let me help you troubleshoot this:\n\nA few quick questions first:\n\n \t* Are you trying to enter the license number directly, or are you importing a license.key file?\n\n \t* Where did you get the license from?\n\n- Directly from GFI/Kerio?\n- Through a reseller?\n- Is this a transferred license from another system?\n\n \t* What version of Kerio Control are you running on your software appliance?\n\n-------------------------\n\nHERE&#39;S WHAT TYPICALLY CAUSES THIS ERROR:\n\nBased on the knowledge base, this error happens when:\n\n \t* The license file information is incorrect or doesn't match your system\n \t* There's a mismatch between the license and the appliance type (software vs hardware)\n \t* The license might still be bound to a different system\n\nLET&#39;S TRY THIS SOLUTION:\n\nStep 1: Download a fresh license file\n\n \t* Go to the Kerio Product Registration page [https://www.kerio.com/support/kerio-control] \n \t* Register using your license number\n \t* Download a fresh license.key file\n\nStep 2: Import it offline\n\n \t* In Kerio Control, go to Dashboard \u2192 Configuration Assistant \u2192 Register product\n \t* Select Register offline by license file\n \t* Import the newly downloaded license.key file\n\n-------------------------\n If this still doesn't work, you'll need to contact the GFI Customer Care team to get an updated license file. They'll need this information from you:\n\n \t* License key\n \t* Customer ID (if you have one)\n \t* Full Name\n \t* Email address registered with the license\n \t* Country\n\nYou can reach them through the GFI Customer Care Center [https://customercare.gfi.com/hc/en-us/requests/new].\n\nLet me know if the fresh download works, or if you need help contacting Customer Care! \ud83d\udd27 \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n internet access is ok, key file is generated by gfi \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Okay, good to know! So you have internet access and you're using a license.key file that was generated by GFI, but it's still giving you the license or verification key error when you try to import it. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n This is interesting. The error you're experiencing could be related to a mismatch between the license type and your appliance. Let me ask a couple more specific questions:\n\nImportant clarification:\n\n \t* When you purchased the license, did you specify it was for a SOFTWARE appliance?\n\n- Licenses are bound to specific appliance types (hardware boxes like NG100/NG300/NG500 vs. software/virtual appliances)\n- If the license was generated for a hardware box but you're using a software appliance (or vice versa), it won't work\n\n \t* Is this a brand new license purchase, or are you trying to transfer/reuse a license from another system?\n\n \t* What's the exact error message you're seeing? Does it say:\n\n- The security code or the license number is not entered correctly\n- License is not for this hardware\n- Cannot load new license file\n- Something else? \n-------------------------\n\nHERE&#39;S WHAT I SUSPECT IS HAPPENING:\n\nBased on the knowledge base articles, license files are bound to the specific Operating System (OS) and appliance type. If there's an inconsistency between what the license was generated for and what you're actually running, you'll get this error.\n\nIf the license was generated for the wrong appliance type, you'll need to contact GFI Customer Care to get it updated. They can regenerate the license file for your software appliance.\n\nCan you tell me more about where/how you purchased this license and what exact error message you're seeing? That will help me guide you to the right solution! \ud83d\udd0d \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n email is hofman@ziva.cz \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thanks for providing your email address! That's helpful information.\n\nNow, to help you resolve this license issue, I still need a bit more context about what's happening. Could you tell me:\n\n \t* What is the exact error message you're seeing when you try to import the license.key file? (For example: The security code or the license number is not entered correctly or License is not for this hardware or something else?)\n\n \t* Is this license for a software/virtual appliance or was it originally for a hardware box (like NG100, NG300, or NG500)?\n\n \t* Is this a new license purchase, or are you migrating/transferring from another Kerio Control system?\n\nUnderstanding these details will help me determine whether:\n\n \t* The license file needs to be regenerated by GFI for your specific appliance type\n \t* There's a different issue we can troubleshoot directly\n \t* We need to get GFI Customer Care involved to update your license\n\nWhat are you seeing on your screen right now? \ud83e\udd14 \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n i wrote that i have appliance !!! \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion! You did mention you have a software appliance at the beginning. I should have paid closer attention to that. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLet me refocus here. So you have:\n\n \t* \u2705 A software appliance\n \t* \u2705 Internet access is working\n \t* \u2705 A license.key file generated by GFI\n \t* \u274c Getting a license or verification key error when trying to import it\n\nWhat I still need to know to help you:\n\n \t* What is the EXACT error message you see when you try to import the license? (The specific wording matters - is it saying not entered correctly, not for this hardware, or something else?)\n\n \t* Is this a brand NEW license you just purchased, or are you trying to move/transfer a license from another Kerio Control system?\n\nThese two pieces of information will tell me whether:\n\n \t* The license file was generated incorrectly for your software appliance type\n \t* There's a binding issue that needs GFI Customer Care to fix\n \t* Or if there's another solution we can try\n\nWhat does the error message say exactly? \ud83d\udd27 \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n i wrote this! appliance has not valid licence \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I understand you're seeing that the appliance doesn't have a valid license, and I know this is frustrating. Let me help you get this sorted out.\n\nSince you have:\n\n \t* A software appliance\n \t* A license.key file from GFI\n \t* Internet access working\n \t* But it's not accepting the license\n\nLet's try to narrow this down:\n\nWhen you try to import the license.key file into Kerio Control:\n\n \t* Where exactly are you importing it?\n\n- Through the web administration interface (Configuration > Registration)?\n- During initial setup?\n\n \t* What happens when you try to upload the file?\n\n- Does it give you a specific error popup?\n- Does it just say invalid without details?\n- Does the upload seem to work but then the license still shows as invalid?\n\n \t* One more important question: When you purchased this license, was it specifically ordered for a SOFTWARE appliance, or could it have been ordered for a hardware box (NG100/NG300/NG500)?\n\nThe reason I'm asking is that based on the technical documentation, licenses are bound to the specific appliance type. If the license was accidentally generated for a hardware box instead of a software appliance, it simply won't work - and you'd need GFI Customer Care to regenerate it for the correct appliance type.\n\nCan you tell me what you see when you try to import the license file? \ud83d\udd0d \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n in configuration registration \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Perfect! So you're in Configuration > Registration trying to import the license.key file.\n\nNow, when you click to upload the license.key file in that section, what exactly happens?\n\nDoes it show:\n\n \t* An error message popup with specific text?\n \t* The license appears to upload but then still shows as Not registered or Invalid?\n \t* Something else?\n\nAlso, this is really important:\n\nWhen this license was purchased/ordered, was it specifically requested for a SOFTWARE/VIRTUAL appliance?\n\nHere's why this matters: According to the technical documentation, license files are bound to the specific Operating System and appliance type. If the license was generated for a hardware box (NG100/NG300/NG500) but you're trying to use it on a software appliance, it will be rejected - even if the license key itself is valid.\n\nIf the license was ordered for the wrong appliance type, we'll need to get GFI Customer Care to regenerate it for your software appliance. They'll need:\n\n \t* Your license key\n \t* Customer ID\n \t* Email address (hofman@ziva.cz)\n \t* Confirmation that you need it for a SOFTWARE appliance\n\nBut first, let me know what you see when you try to upload the file - does it give you any specific error text? \ud83d\udccb \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n ugh!!! i wrote to you already, licence is 20339-3L1LN-8977B \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n You're right, I apologize for the frustration! I see your license number is 20339-3L1LN-8977B.\n\nLet me check what information I can find about this specific issue and licensing problems with software appliances. \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Based on the technical documentation, I can see what's likely happening here. License files are bound to the specific Operating System and appliance type.\n\nThe issue is that your license file may have been generated for the wrong type of appliance. Since you have a software appliance, but the license might have been generated for a hardware box (NG100/NG300/NG500), it won't be accepted.\n\nHere's what needs to happen:\n\nYou'll need to contact GFI Customer Care to have them regenerate the license file specifically for your software appliance. They can update the license binding.\n\nContact GFI Customer Care here: GFI Customer Care Center [https://customercare.gfi.com/hc/en-us/requests/new]\n\nProvide them with this information:\n\n \t* License key: 20339-3L1LN-8977B\n \t* Customer ID: (your customer ID)\n \t* Full Name: (your name)\n \t* Email address: hofman@ziva.cz\n \t* Country: (your country)\n \t* Important: Specify that you need the license for a SOFTWARE/VIRTUAL APPLIANCE (not a hardware box)\n\nThey'll generate a new license.key file that's properly bound to your software appliance, and then it should import successfully.\n\nWould you like me to help you create a support ticket for this right now? \ud83c\udfab \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Hi, Milos Hofman ! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nThis is the Kerio Control ATLAS support chat. \n-------------------------\n\n Please note: ATLAS is very smart and helpful, but like any GenAI assistant, he may provide incorrect responses from time to time.

Let's focus on the technical issue you're experiencing with your license.\n\nYou mentioned that you installed Kerio Control appliance from ISO and need a new license key for new hardware. Let me gather a bit more information to help you properly:\n\n \t* Is this a completely new hardware installation, or are you migrating from old hardware to new hardware?\n\n \t* Do you currently have an active Kerio Control license from your previous setup, or is this a brand new deployment?\n\n \t* What exactly is happening when you try to apply the license? Are you seeing any specific error messages, or do you simply not have a license key to enter?\n\nUnderstanding whether this is a hardware migration or a fresh installation will help me guide you through the correct process for getting your license sorted out! \ud83d\udd11 \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n 1: migration to new hardware, the old one is broken. 2. yes i have vali license. 3. i got error on connection to appmanager. I got you have not valid license for appliance \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Thank you for those details! This makes sense now. When you migrate Kerio Control to new hardware, the license is tied to the specific hardware/OS configuration, so you're getting that invalid license for appliance error because your existing license is still bound to the old broken hardware.\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\nSOLUTION: HARDWARE/OS MODEL CHANGE\n\nSince you're migrating to new hardware with a valid existing license, you need to request a hardware model change for your license. This will unbind the license from the old hardware and allow it to work on your new appliance.\n\nHere's the process:\n\n \t* Update your license via this article: How can I update my Kerio Connect or Kerio Control OS or Hardware model? [https://support.keriocontrol.gfi.com/article/120220] \n\n \t* If you encounter any issues, you can contact the GFI Customer Care Center [https://customercare.gfi.com/hc/en-us/requests/new] and provide: \n\n- Your license key\n- New hardware box Serial Number (SN)\n- Customer ID\n- Full Name\n- Email address registered in the license details\n- Country\n- (Optional but helpful) Previous hardware SN or license key\n\nOnce the hardware model change is processed, you'll receive an updated license key that will work with your new appliance. After that, the old unit will stop working with that license (which is fine since it's broken anyway).\n\nImportant: Make sure you have a backup of your configuration from the old appliance so you can restore it to the new one after the license is updated!\n\nDo you have a backup of your configuration from the old hardware, or do we need to address that as well? \ud83d\udd27 \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n license key:\n20339-3L1LN-8977B serial number of HW i don't know because it is installed on proxmox virtualization because kerio os has kernel 2... new kernel 6 has support for newest intel ethernet. customer ID is 14535, my name is Milos Hofman, company ZIVA a.s., COuntry Czech Republic, email address hofman@ziva.cz \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n Ah, this is an important detail! You're migrating from a hardware appliance to a virtual appliance (Proxmox), which is actually a different scenario than hardware-to-hardware migration.\n\nAccording to the licensing policy, you cannot directly transfer a license between hardware appliances and software/virtual appliances because each license has metadata that binds it to a specific appliance type (hardware vs. virtual/software).\n\nHERE&#39;S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:\n\nSince you're moving from a hardware appliance to a virtual/software appliance on Proxmox, you'll need to contact GFI Sales/Account Management to handle this license conversion. This isn't something that can be done through the standard hardware model change process.\n\nContact Information:\n\n \t* GFI Customer Care Center: https://customercare.gfi.com/hc/en-us/requests/new \n\nInformation to provide:\n\n \t* License key: 20339-3L1LN-8977B\n \t* Customer ID: 14535\n \t* Name: Milos Hofman\n \t* Company: ZIVA a.s.\n \t* Country: Czech Republic\n \t* Email: hofman@ziva.cz\n \t* Migration details: Moving from hardware appliance to virtual appliance (Proxmox) due to hardware failure and need for newer kernel support\n\nNote: Since the serial number is for a virtual installation, you can mention that you're installing Kerio Control as a virtual appliance on Proxmox and explain the reason (old kernel 2.x vs. new kernel 6 for Intel Ethernet support).\n\nWould you like me to help you create a support ticket for this license conversion request right now? \ud83c\udfab \n\n--- Customer (Milos Hofman) ---\n\n customer care send me to Atlas! please make from conversation support request for technician \n\n--- AI Assistant ---\n\n I understand your frustration, and a human colleague will be happy to assist you further with creating a support request.
