The expired certificates caused SSLCertVerificationError messages and failed HTTPS connections, disrupting customer chat functionalities.\ud83d\ude80 Resolution EffectivenessRoot Cause: The root cause was clearly identified as expired SSL certificates on the AWS ALB for Brand Messenger services.Actions Taken: New SSL certificates were generated and updated in AWS ACM for both usw2 and euw1 regions. The certificates were committed to the repository, uploaded, and attached to the load balancers. Post-update verification confirmed the resolution.Evidence: The resolution is supported by logs showing SSLCertVerificationError messages, comments detailing the certificate renewal process, and openssl verification confirming the new certificates' validity through July 2026.Monitoring: The incident was detected through customer reports rather than automated monitoring. A ticket should be created in the MONAUTO project to enhance monitoring for SSL certificate expirations.Non-Execution: Not applicable, as the resolution was executed successfully.\ud83d\udcdd Process AdherenceCommunication: The communication in the comments and resolution summary was clear and timely, detailing the steps taken and confirming resolution.Documentation: The documentation was comprehensive, including logs, screenshots, and detailed comments on the resolution process.Runbook Usage/Creation: There is no mention of a runbook. Given the nature of the incident, a runbook should be created to guide future SSL certificate renewals and prevent similar incidents.\ud83d\udcca MetricsInvestigation Quality: 5/5 (The root cause analysis was thorough and accurate.)Documentation Quality: 5/5 (Comments and resolution summary were clear and complete.)Resolution Effectiveness: 5/5 (Actions taken were effective and supported by evidence.)Total score: 15/15\ud83d\udca1 Suggestions for Improvement1. Implement automated monitoring for SSL certificate expirations to prevent similar incidents.2. Create a runbook for SSL certificate management, including renewal processes and verification steps.3. Enhance communication protocols to ensure timely detection and reporting of similar issues.\u2705 Final AssessmentThis analysis was performed to ensure quality and completeness."
