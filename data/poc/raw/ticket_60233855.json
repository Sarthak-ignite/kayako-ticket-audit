The root cause is that the BoardQueryConstraints class does not properly handle the full ancestor ID format (e.g., \"category:canaries\") and only forwards the ID portion (\"canaries\") to subsequent processing steps, while other similar query constraints correctly include the type prefix using the includeType() method. The Engineering team has implemented a fix by overriding the setAncestorId method in BoardQueryConstraints.java to call ancestorId.includeType(), ensuring the complete ancestor ID format is preserved during query processing, and the fix has been verified through manual API testing and submitted via pull request #615.\n\n\n> Created with [Taro](https://github.com/trilogy-group/taro/tree/shell).

That input is parsed to object IDRef, which is {type:category, id: canaries} in this case.\n- If relying on default ancestorId implementation, only \"canaries\" is forwarded to next steps, which is not expected\n- A similar situation can be seen through [NodeQueryConstraints.java](https://github.com/lithiumtech/lia/blob/b119cc982b0663d5309dcc84353c94cc6b362254/dev/lia/components/restv2/src/main/java/lithium/api/graphql/schema/query/nodes/NodeQueryConstraints.java) which also require similar syntax, such as \"board:board-id\". And it set ancestorId by:\n```\n@Override\npublic void setAncestorId(IDEqlInConstraint ancestorId) {\n\tsuper.setAncestorId(ancestorId.includeType());\n}\n```\n\n=> This must be an edge case for boards query and cause by lack of proper OOP inheritance.\n\n## Test Plan\nAPI Manual test:\n- Follow steps in section **Verification**\n- Expected: Not empty, similar to below\n\n<img width=\"1512\" height=\"784\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/532719b5-7fd8-4fb5-b0b0-ad0fc164eb77\" />\n\n## Test results\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9e38468-1340-4544-808d-89a00f4ff84e\n\n## Deliverables\nhttps://github.com/lithiumtech/lia/pull/615\n"

          "GHI Engineering - 13744 // trilogy-taro[bot] commented: # Engineering Issue Bot\n\n## Issue Analysis\n\nThis issue involves a GraphQL query constraint failure where the `ancestorId` constraint for fetching boards returns zero results when it should return all boards under the specified ancestor category.\n\n## Issue Reproduction\n\n**Environment**: https://italentcorp5.stage.lithium.com/t5/s/api/2.1/graphql\n\n**GraphQL Query Tested**:\n```graphql\nquery MyQuery {\n  boards(constraints: {ancestorId: {eq: \"category:Fabric_Ideas\"}}) {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        conversationStyle\n        title\n        id\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**: Return all boards under the \"category:Fabric_Ideas\" ancestor\n**Actual Behavior**: Returns empty result set (zero boards)\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n### API Layer Analysis\nThe GraphQL API endpoint at `/t5/s/api/2.1/graphql` is receiving and parsing the query correctly, but the constraint evaluation for `ancestorId` is failing during query execution.\n\n### Logic Layer Analysis\nThe most likely root causes for this issue are:\n\n1. **Incorrect Ancestor ID Format Handling**: The constraint processor may not be correctly parsing the \"category:\" prefix in the ancestor ID\n2. **Missing Index or Relationship Mapping**: The database query generated from the GraphQL constraint may be missing proper joins for ancestor relationships\n3. **Case Sensitivity Issues**: The ancestor ID comparison might be case-sensitive when it shouldn't be\n4. **Permission/Visibility Filtering**: Results might be filtered out due to permission checks after the query\n\n### Persistence Layer Analysis\nThe boards-to-ancestors relationship query is likely failing due to:\n- Missing or incorrect database index on ancestor relationships\n- Incorrect SQL generation for hierarchical queries\n- Potential data inconsistency where boards exist but ancestor relationships are not properly stored\n\n## Resolution Approach\n\nSince access to the Khoros Aurora Community codebase is restricted, I cannot directly implement and test the fix. However, based on the analysis, the following approach would resolve the issue:\n\n### Required Code Changes\n\n1. **GraphQL Resolver Update**:\n   - Locate the boards query resolver that handles BoardConstraints\n   - Fix the ancestorId constraint processing to properly handle the \"category:\" prefix\n   - Ensure the constraint generates correct database queries for ancestor relationships\n\n2. **Database Query Optimization**:\n   - Add or fix indexes on board-ancestor relationship tables\n   - Ensure hierarchical queries properly traverse the ancestor tree\n\n3. **Validation Enhancement**:\n   - Add input validation for ancestorId format\n   - Implement proper error messages for invalid ancestor IDs\n\n### Test Plan\n\n1. **Unit Tests**:\n   - Test ancestorId constraint with various formats (with/without prefix)\n   - Test empty and invalid ancestor IDs\n   - Test nested ancestor hierarchies\n\n2. **Integration Tests**:\n   - Verify boards are returned for valid ancestor IDs\n   - Test multiple constraint combinations\n   - Validate performance with large board sets\n\n3. **E2E Tests**:\n   - Execute the original failing query and verify it returns results\n   - Test via GraphQL playground on staging environment\n   - Verify no regression in other board query constraints\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo make progress on this issue:\n\n1. **Access Required**: Need access to the Khoros Aurora Community codebase (lithiumtech organization repositories) to implement the fix\n2. **Investigation Needed**:\n   - Examine the actual GraphQL schema definition for BoardConstraints\n   - Review the resolver implementation for the boards query\n   - Analyze the database schema for board-ancestor relationships\n3. **Collaboration**: Contact the Khoros Aurora team or someone with repository access to proceed with implementation\n\n## Alternative Solutions\n\nIf the main approach cannot be implemented:\n\n1. **Workaround**: Query all boards without constraints and filter client-side (not recommended for production)\n2. **Alternative Query**: Use different constraints or query ancestors separately then fetch their boards\n3. **API Version**: Check if newer API versions have this issue fixed\n\n## Verdict\n\n**Likelihood of Correctness**: 75%\n\nThe analysis identifies the probable root cause in the GraphQL constraint processing for ancestorId. However, without access to the actual codebase and ability to test the fix, full verification cannot be completed. The issue requires someone with repository access to the Khoros Aurora Community codebase to implement and test the solution."
