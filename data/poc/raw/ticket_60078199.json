And then I will create the logs etc. again.\n\nThe mails in the provider mailbox only exist once, see screenshot. That is not the problem. From the moment MailEssentails retrieves them, they are duplicated. So there is an error in MailEssentails. And because there are not many setting options for the POP3 download. The error must be in the software code during processing.\n\nThe Kerio setting for duplicate mail is nice but does not work so that the mals come from MailEssentails to Kerio via relay. So not an option."
